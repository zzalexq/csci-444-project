"We've fought and fought and fought and fought and fought , but I think we really like each other's company .

The <chinese_authorities> certainly hope that this demonstration under the banner of "Occupy China" will be more like the tiger-headed "Occupy Wall Street" movement , rather than the student movement of 1989 . Lastly , compared to 1989 , the authorities now have more room for manoeuvre , as long as they are willing to take advantage of that room--because <hong_kong> is not a capital , a city that has enjoyed special status under the "one country , two systems" model since the British handed it over to China .

I recently gave a speech to hundreds of representatives at a large-scale corporate conference , speaking to middle-level managers of large companies . Speaking at the conference , I realized that the spirit of entrepreneurship I had mentioned had nothing to do with them--even an offense . Because I had been preaching the doctrine of independence , freedom and risk-taking , and they had been buried in a warm , windless tomb of a large company . They had worked for large institutions all their lives , and for them , their struggle to entrepreneurship was incompatible with them .

Journalists have hardly ever grown up , and entrepreneurs have too . Sir Richard Branson and <steve_jobs> certainly don't think of themselves as adults . As for <bill_gates> , it's hard to say : he's a dork , neither fully man nor fully child . In more traditional organizations , a grown-up image is usually necessary to get promoted .

As time passed , as these figures grew at an unchanging rate , an explosive change occurred , and that is how small money became a fortune . He could visually describe the compound growth of these figures as he pushed a snowball on the grass , and the snowball grew bigger and bigger . Warren began to view time in a different way . The compound growth connects the "now" to the "future ."

Today , the <minority_shareholders> in Richard Li's <holding_company> voted against the plan , refusing to sell its 23 per cent stake to a consortium in which Richard Li's father , billionaire LiKa-shing , is involved . The vote was in line with Li's wishes , but at the same time , the challenge that initially forced him to negotiate with the bidders remains : how to make up for the lost value of buying <hong_kong> Telecom (HongkongTelecom) for $280 billion at the peak of the Internet bubble -- even if it is only part of it .

Enid Yip , <chief_executive> for Asia , said : "The expectation of a surge in wealth has exacerbated some of the problems facing some of the <private_banks> in Asia .

Over the past three years , I have been paying close attention to the growing distrust of German <finance_minister> Peter Steinbrück , whose lack of diplomatic skills has attracted so much attention only because it has become more widely known . Indeed , he has always said so , and his attacks on the "Anglo-Saxons" are now profound in Germany .

The former powers do not understand this new reality . Of course , they agree with the need to reform <international_institutions> . You will hear Western politicians argue that the <emerging_countries> must have greater say . Perhaps the World Bank , the <united_nations> and the IMF Council will get more seats . But the idea is that the emerging powers will only adapt to the existing system – adjust a little here , change a little there , and then it will all be fine . What is lacking here is a willingness to see this as a moment of transformation , demanding that we look at the world in a new light .

Overall , the reform programmes for 2008 and beyond that have been legally defined , including a significant reduction in corporate taxes , a gradual increase in the <retirement_age> and minimum wages in some areas , and more generous child-rearing benefits , will still make Germany a better place to invest . But , ahead of a series of state <parliamentary_elections> that began in early 2008 and the federal elections at the end of 2009 , many Socialists have made more demands : additional 6 to 12 months of unemployment benefits for workers aged 50 and over , a significant increase in the national <minimum_wage> , and the dismissal of temporary employment by some reverse intermediaries .

The United Kingdom's threat to revoke diplomatic privileges for the Ecuadorian embassy in order to arrest Julian Assange is nothing more than a diplomatic ploy .

Ecuador's decision yesterday to grant political asylum to Assange did not change his plight .

<prime_minister_naoto_kan> speaks very clearly about the dangers of a consumption tax that has been a political poison in Japan since Japan first discussed the re-introduction in the late 1970s , and has been linked to at least two attempts to raise taxes since 1993 .Some people believe that the Democratic Party's defeat could lead him to become the fifth consecutive <prime_minister> of Japan for less than a year , but the tax issue is not the only reason for the Democratic Party's defeat .

I don't really want to hang out with them . But the word lunch , which is used to express such degrading allegory and such blatant gender discrimination , really annoys me . In people's imaginations , these ladies are obsessed with the typical place where they have dinner , which should be a restaurant in a <department_store> . They are in a state of mindlessness , in a brief break from a round of insane shopping , drinking a little of Chardonnay , a kind of delicious white wine similar to that of Shabelle . This is certainly the interpretation of what lunch really means .

First , rising <trade_surpluses> may lead to <trade_disputes> , which they hope will be avoided , and fears that large volumes of cheap steel exports to Europe and the <united_states> could exacerbate protectionist tendencies .Some in Europe have begun calling for restrictions on <chinese_steel> imports , and <eu_trade_commissioner> <peter_mandelson> recently said China's rapidly growing <trade_surplus> is "unsustainable".

Officials in the <trump_administration> have been engaged in intense debates over recent months on how to negotiate a deal with Beijing , aimed at reducing the <us_trade_deficit> with China and promoting China’s <structural_reforms> .

What is eroding trust ? Is it the result of financial waste (as Greece was exposed at the beginning of the crisis)? Is it the result of a loss of competitiveness ? Is it the result of a <current_account> imbalance ? Undoubtedly , these are factors that exacerbate the lack of trust . But the fact that the crisis has spread to so many eurozone members points to a more general cause : the eurozone’s inadequate design – inadequate monitoring , inadequate enforcement of rules , and the absence of a crisis management framework .
The key point is that the <current_account> imbalance is a reflection of the flow of <international_investment> , not always from <rich_countries> to <poor_countries> , but from economies with high savings rates such as China to countries with high consumption tendencies such as the <united_states> . Sir Lawson gave an example of the old Halifax Building Society , which , in its heyday , directed savings from the northern part of Britain towards spending more freely in the south .

Of course , the <hong_kong_government> has no responsibility for the electorate , but in young democracies such as Taiwan or the Philippines , the situation is no different . They are all in turmoil , not only because the leadership is powerless , but also because opposition legislators are more keen to oust the current government than to push forward a positive policy agenda .
Many conservatives in the <united_states> would not be so shy . An article by Max Boot of the <united_states> Council for Foreign Relations covertly titled "The Case for American Empire ." The influential columnist Charles Krauthammer called the <united_states> "the world's dominant power , more dominant than any country since the Roman Empire . The <united_states> is in a position to create a new reality ." Krauthammer suggested that this should be done by "showing no apologies and no mercy ."

Most <chinese_officials> like to use words such as harmony and dynamism to accentuate their rhetoric . In Nanjing , the word "historic city" is often used .

If the financial environment improves and leads to a reduction in current high <borrowing_costs> and the <real_economy> , the 30 richer members of the OECD could experience an unexpectedly rapid recovery .

For China's "qualified domestic institutional investors" (QDIIs), although the government has eased their investment limits on overseas stocks to half of the current quota , this means that only $70 billion to $90 billion may flow overseas .The <hong_kong_stock_market> is clearly the preferred destination , where it will not digest the funds in a day , and even that amount may not be released immediately .In contrast to the mainland's renminbi-denominated A <stock_market> , the <hong_kong_stock_market> is less attractive .This year , the mainland's <stock_market> has risen by 48%.

The isolation system succeeded in a terrible way . It assumed that different "races" were born differently , and thereby created genuinely different races . Blacks and whites in <south_africa> grew up in different communities , spoke different languages , attended different schools , earned different incomes , and lived different lives . The isolation was designed to create discrimination between blacks and whites . I remember standing in front of an ice cream car in Johannesburg when I was about 10 years old , and I saw the following scene : A white customer with a beard accused black merchants of being too slow . He shouted , "You're stupid ! You shouldn't do this job ! Hurry , give me ice cream !"

Washington says Beijing's media policy "contradicts China's desire to build a modern information economy" and violates fundamental rights , while the <european_commission> says it "strongly opposes such restrictive measures".
The push is clear : China's inflation remains alarmingly high , and the renminbi's strength both eases import price pressures and reduces the central bank's need to further "print money" to lower the <exchange_rate> . Given the expectation that inflation will rise in May and June , the policy of accelerating the renminbi's appreciation will receive more support within the government than it does on weekdays .
But a thorough reform of the <capital_markets> is precisely the prerequisite for creating a stronger <financial_system> , more effective <monetary_policy> , and more flexible exchange-rate mechanisms .

From current evidence , the attitude of Israeli intelligence and military officials to such actions ranges from highly cautious to strong opposition . On the other hand , <benjamin_netanyahu> may be very selfish and negligent in ignoring them .
Optimists argue that Greece's collapse now seems unlikely to permanently damage the fragile European <monetary_union> (EMU).The Alliance points out that the overall situation in the eurozone is relatively good compared to other large economies , with debt totalling 78 .2% of <gross_domestic_product> (GDP).Japan's debt ratio is much higher , at around 190 per cent , and the US's level of 83 .1% surpasses that of the eurozone .But as Spain , Ireland , and the United Kingdom plan unprecedented austerity , all <european_leaders> will face a huge test of political courage in the coming years .

Without kidding , you should focus on doing your job well . The flow of time will help , partly because you are getting closer and closer to retirement -- I think retirement is your ultimate goal .

Earlier this month , the UK Treasury market seemed to be overwhelmed by the government's booming demands , when the Bank of England (BOE) rushed to rescue , announcing that it would spend billions of pounds on buying <government_bonds> . As a result , the country's bonds soared . Economists cheered , but their reaction was wrong . The so-called <quantitative_easing> policy posed a serious risk to British creditors .

On Saturday afternoon , I went out shopping in an imperfect state , because I had no idea what to do with my children and my drunkenness the night before . I searched around trying to find a dress that was both respectful and slightly fashionable . I couldn't afford to wear a suit with accessories that would make me look like Elvis the cat's mother , and , for serious considerations , I couldn't afford to look like Garland's famous dress : a headscarf , an evening gown and a shirt . I didn't want blue stripes of cotton either , which was not appropriate in April in <new_york> , and a strange suit , especially when we were going to eat at the restaurant .

The goal must be to differentiate between Trump and his fans . Trump is a small-minded salesman . His fans are a forgotten group in the <united_states> .

Obama can set an example in this regard .

The first impression - very misleading - that you come to Abuja is that it is no longer normal . You enter a charming country house on the far shore . Everything we have heard and read about the restaurant before is scattered in its charm ; from an art-filled website to pre-booked food and dining products , it looks very fashionable . In fact , the interior decoration is large and beautiful , but often surprising : tiled floors , white walls , comfortable table chairs , and stalls of bulldogs all over the place (named for the restaurant's name , which was originally named for a German couple from the 1960s).The courteous waiters welcome you , who are actually very friendly , efficient and knowledgeable , even though they wear black uniforms and look more fashionable than most customers .

For <financial_reform> , the NTSB is a convincing model . As a fully independent , non-regulatory government agency , the NTSB's main task is to investigate aircraft accidents , provide detailed , conclusive judicial assessments and make recommendations for future avoidance of similar accidents . When an accident occurs , the NTSB will form an experienced team of engineers and flight safety experts who will arrive quickly at the scene of the accident and conduct thorough investigations . They will interview witnesses , review history flight logs and maintain records , clean the wreckage , and search for "black boxes". If necessary , they will also reassemble the aircraft to determine the underlying cause of the crash . Once these tasks are completed , the NTSB will issue a report (which will enter a public database available for retrieval), summarize the investigations , and make specific recommendations for preventing future similar accidents . This process has been one of the key factors in obtaining exceptional safety records for commercial flights .

The root of the problem lies in the failure of both sides to resolve long-standing border disputes that led to a brief but bloody war between the two countries in 1962 . China's government claims it owns 9 ,000 square kilometres of land in the Indian state of Arunachal , bordering Bhutan and Tibet . India , meanwhile , claims that China occupies 3 .8 million square kilometres of India's territory in the Kashmiri region and that Pakistan has leased it illegally . This open dispute is one of several factors that has stimulated relations between the two countries , and could be triggered in unexpected areas , causing losses to businesses and investors . For example , due to concerns about the security risks of strategic facilities , New Delhi recently failed to impose immigration restrictions on <chinese_workers> , forcing Chinese firms to suspend the construction of <power_plants> contracted in India , which is what India needs to fill its severe energy shortage .

The <united_states> faces enormous challenges both at home and abroad , but its fiscal situation is not a big problem . This could cause a great deal of controversy .

Yes , the <united_states> does face fiscal challenges in the long run , but this is largely due to the dramatic increase in the cost of its inefficient health care system . Yes , the <united_states> is in fierce controversy over <fiscal_policy> , but this stems from the philosophical debate about what role the government should play . Yes , the <united_states> is indeed operating temporarily behind a huge <fiscal_deficit> , but this is the result of the <financial_crisis> .

Government deficits now account for more than 10% of GDP in countries such as the United Kingdom and the <united_states> .

While the number and amount of acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific region has risen rapidly , most of them have been concentrated in Japan and Australia , where buyers are still faced with too many obstacles to take the field further : policy risks remain high , as evidenced by Thailand's stringent capital control measures and surveys conducted by LoneStar in <south_korea> ; in many sectors , foreign holdings are still banned and ownership is limited to a small number of shares , especially in China and India ; and a large number of companies are still subject to the will of family or government owners – Morgan Stanley estimates that in the Asia-Pacific region , excluding Japan , family power has considerable influence over 40 to 50 per cent of <listed_companies> .

Don't laugh when you see works that make you shy . But the arrogance and contempt go far too far , and even if you are the best in this field with the art gallery boss , be cool and frosty . Don't be shy when you ask for the price of an artwork ; but remember : you must never mention what kind of currency these artworks are priced in . (Reference Proverbs 2 ).

Meanwhile , intelligence papers and government announcements tell us that British people of all ages are suffering from a lonely epidemic .

China's <xinhua_news_agency> and other media cited Xi's speech as pushing ahead with the "early" issuance of the licenses .

One of the most thriving practices in the development of the English country is to comment on the work of <john_maynard_keynes> . What did Keynes say ? When did he say it ?

To some extent , it is useful for the <communist_party> . Chinese do not have an official way of expressing their views in public , such as elections . Therefore , having some degree of freedom of speech is a good way to grasp the emotions of "non-electors ." It is also a way to eliminate appalling corruption or other illegal behaviour by <local_officials> who are away from <central_government> surveillance and may be abusing power .

The surprise of the Presidents Club scandal is that the charity has succeeded in getting 360 people to agree to a dinner party , partly because it is a dinner party that only invites men . In principle , there is nothing wrong with single-sex activities . But in the context of enterprises , some large-scale activities are also strange . This is a relic of the past , when women were promoted without doors , because real social activities occurred on the occasions they were not invited to , between the cups they didn't like to change , and after they had gone home early to get their children to sleep .
After being questioned , he shifted his stance , arguing that as trade gradually moves to online trading , the number of jobs "threatened" would rise at the same rate and would require adjustment assistance .

In the coming months , however , elected representatives will be determined to ignore them . Looking ahead to the November election , both parties believe that blaming the other party can gain a greater advantage . What is more important , given the tactical advantage it has over the other party , about Congress's policy and status ? The candidates are convinced that the most important thing is to drum up core supporters . What is more important , as long as their Republicans (or their Democrats) are more invisible than we are , and as long as our Democrats (or our Republicans) are not seen by the general public ?

It is clear from Paul Ryan’s election as Republican vice president that the two parties have reached a consensus that the core issue of this <presidential_election> will be the size and scope of the federal government’s influence on American <economic_activity> .

The substantive content of the regulation has not received widespread public attention and has been concealed by the GDPR , which has already entered into force . This is unfortunate because the law will bring about important paradigm shifts in relation to key issues of data privacy .

The report recommends setting a target for atmospheric concentrations of <carbon_dioxide> and other <greenhouse_gases> , ranging from 450 ppm to 550 ppm : if the target concentration is too high , the climate risk is too high ; if the target concentration is too low , the costs involved are too high . Given current trends , even achieving this target will require considerable effort . However , the longer we delay , the greater the risk and the higher the cost of counteracting these risks : "The delay in taking action will lead to greater <climate_change> and ultimately to higher governance costs ." Given the costs and benefits estimated in the report , early action seems wise . However , this conclusion depends to some extent on the discount rate used . The report wisely points out that , in essence , the happiness of our generation is no more important than the happiness of our generation . The only other reason for higher discount rates is higher <economic_growth> rates . However , if <climate_change> causes a significant slowdown in <economic_growth> (which seems to be possible), then lower discount rates should be used . If so , the reasons for early action are more sufficient .
The industrialized economies of Middle <eastern_europe> have begun to transition to a <market_economy> without a <financial_system> , and it has taken almost 10 years for their fragile banks to actually extend credit to governments , large corporations , and the rich .

The CDU , led by <angela_merkel> , and the free-market FDP won the election , benefiting Germany’s economy and businesses . But the benefits remain to be seen . The election results are complex . Contrary to self-conception , Germany seems to be moving to the right despite the failure of its traditional right-wing policies .

The CDU , which once won 90 per cent of the vote , and the Social <democratic_party> (SDP) won less than 57 per cent of the vote , the lowest in nearly 60 years .

Yesterday , however , the dollar hit the renminbi's <exchange_rate> at $1 to 6 .26 yuan , the highest since October 2012 .The weaker daily guide price (which can fluctuate around 2%) reflects that the <chinese_central_bank> is continuing to guide the <exchange_rate> downwards .The theory that the renminbi's decline will not last is that if the renminbi's <exchange_rate> slips downwards , the practice of borrowing in dollars cheaply , using false trade invoices , and converting funds into rising (and higher-interest) renminbi will soon stop .This may solve the problem of China's volatility in trade data and eliminate an unwelcome factor that has led to the renminbi's rise .
Japan’s government “can’t even imply” that it is reconsidering its nuclear policy , otherwise it would undermine its position as one of the advocates of a nuclear non-proliferation treaty , or affect its affirmation by the <international_atomic_energy_agency> (IAEA) that Japan is a country that allows a complete nuclear cycle .
Peter Harbison , <executive_director> of the Sydney-based consultancy Centre for <asia_pacific> Aviation , said : "Tom is undoubtedly a strong leader , and he has led Thailand through a difficult period , and what I find surprising about him is not only that he has completely misjudged the prospects of low-cost airlines in the Asia-Pacific region , but that he clearly still firmly believes , for whatever reason , that they have no prospects ... pragmatism may not be his biggest advantage .

The current size of the U .S . economy is less than 17 per cent of what it would have been if the trend from 1968 to 2007 had been maintained . Since the recovery in 2009 , the growth trend has slowed considerably . This may have changed , but it has not yet happened .

But that answer is not enough . There are obvious problems with these reports from the National Shareholders' Authority . The government owns companies such as Royal Mail and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority . The reason for nationalization is that it involves huge public interests , not only in terms of the financial returns from these activities , but also in terms of what and how the enterprise operates . The government has no relationship with the holding companies , and it is not possible or desirable for it to operate as the owner of the <private_equity> .

"The Star Wars series is remarkable to me because it tells the story of the virtual world . We all like to reflect things from the real world -- but in a highly abstract way . In the movie , we can see it as a shadow of the real world , but it's been artfully processed -- a kind of timeless phenomenon . I think Star Wars is very familiar with this .

The late , 89-year-old George W . Bush , who was no different from his predecessor , could hardly be defeated by his achievements in the White House .

A truly good currency should be durable , portable , divideable , unified , limited in supply and acceptable to the public . Can cryptocurrencies meet these demands ? The <sharp_drop> in cryptocurrencies prices indicates that cryptocurrencies are clearly not a value-saving instrument or a good bookkeeping unit . Cryptocurrencies are also not a good exchange medium , as law-abiding citizens and businesses are reluctant to hold assets that are suitable for criminals , terrorists and money launderers because of anonymity .

For a group that so far appears relatively unaffected by the <credit_crunch> , this is a worrying thing . MacGrey's <operating_profits> rose 15 per cent in the previous fiscal year to $82 .8 billion . Much of the previous fiscal year coincided with the <credit_crunch> . MacGrey's basic philosophy was to buy infrastructure assets and bundle them into a fund and charge the cost of the <investment_bank> in the process , which seemed to have little impact . But the cracks have begun to show . As the <credit_market> weakened , the group's long-term financing rates rose by about 100 <basis_points> . The bank was forced to reduce its <real_estate> investments and tighten its mortgage business .

If you rent a house in London , you can spend the same money renting a house twice as big in <new_york> -- everyone tells me that . Children will remember this experience all their lives . Should we come out of respect for our short life and force ourselves to catch up with the light international wave ? We don't both depend on London to work , and we can love it anyway . Or should we make the most painless , destructive and possibly the lowest possible choice ? What did the priest say at our wedding ? "Men are higher than heaven , men are heaven"? But he's not my boss . It seems like everyone thinks that choosing a house on the corner (similar to our original house) is a huge failure . But I like my own life . I don't think there's a need to avoid crowds . But I just like this idea on my own .

As in other parts of the world , such a relaxation has so far been ineffective . Given that it usually takes more than 12 months to take effect , it is no surprise that any slight increases – such as the recent growth in lending in China and India – may be just a flash of lightning , reflecting the release of depressed demand rather than a new investment momentum . However , given that Asian banks are generally better off than their US or European counterparts and are less focused on reducing loan sizes , lenders will theoretically be able to channel cheaper funds more quickly to businesses and households . <asian_governments> are often more persuasive in allowing banks to lend .

The effect of the ECB's <financial_support> in the absence of appropriate policies is reflected in the ECB's long-term refinancing of <eurozone_banks> , in which some of the relevant funds are used to buy <sovereign_bonds> .

The market trends of the past few weeks should be seen as a warning . For many months now , we have clearly seen that there has been a delay in inflation and a slowdown in <economic_growth> in the <united_states> .

After all , China's <real_estate> and infrastructure construction are the main drivers of commodity demand . Concerns about collapses in both sectors , which together account for more than half of China's GDP , may be somewhat overblown . Last year , China's <fixed_asset_investment> grew by about a quarter , and continued urbanization should keep it strong . Meanwhile , <real_estate_investment> grew by a third . Despite the Chinese government's keen desire to slow down this extremely rapid growth , it is also worried about collapses in <real_estate> markets . Housing security projects are moving forward . Moreover , policymakers can still use some tools to prevent a recession as long as inflation is not out of control (estimated at around 4% in December last year).

This is not the first time that the objectivity of the U .S . patent system has been questioned . In last year's patent trial against Samsung , many people felt that the California jury's sympathy gave Apple a great advantage .

It is intolerable that , in order to obtain a satisfactory result , the <russian_government> has manipulated the election process : this strange signal shows Putin’s weakness rather than his strength , because no one doubts that the majority of the population will vote according to the government’s will in their own interests . Although the two elections were markedly defective , they remained legitimate . On March 2 , the government provided voters with an opportunity to choose , and many took the opportunity . One-fifth of voters voted in favour of the Russian Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov – almost twice as many as expected . One-tenth of voters voted in favour of right-wing politician Vladimirhirinovsky .

It would seem that either a depreciation of the dollar or a decline in US <asset_prices> , or both , would be inevitable . Moreover , it is hard to imagine that a falling <exchange_rate> would not play a major role in this pattern . The <united_states> borrows entirely in its own currency , which could make the deficit safer for the <united_states> itself , but the risks to creditors are higher . Therefore , if the dollar was devalued – and thus expected to rise – it would be easier for the <united_states> <net_debt> to be maintained at such a large scale , which is one of the reasons that such fluctuations often overlap .
Moreover , the northeast region is hard to attract investors , the only region in China where private fixed-asset investment declined between 2016 and 2017 .

Ryan’s attempt to replace Medicare with inevitablely devalued health insurance certificates has been distanced by his Republican colleagues . Several years ago , <us_president> George W .

New Pirates : Modern Global Piracy from Somalia to the <south_china_sea> , Andrew Palmer , IBM Tauris , £22 .5
The U .S . government believes the recovery will accelerate rapidly . Last week , <president_barack_obama> described the slowdown as a "stumbling block on the road ."

"There are more and more calls for Russia to rescue this impossible situation , which puts us in an extremely complicated situation ," said Lavrov .

On the contrary , I chose the event in which Musharraf declared a nationwide state of emergency , a country that seems to have gathered all the toughest issues in American <foreign_policy> : the development of democracy , the fight against terrorism , and the suppression of nuclear proliferation . But in Pakistan , the <united_states> found its ally a military regime , a nuclear proliferator , an uncertain ally in wars such as the one against terrorism and the one against the Taliban in Afghanistan . Musharraf’s decision to tighten up power and soften up the country’s judges has embarrassed the West and demonstrated how unstable Pakistan remains . But the <united_states> has not abandoned its relationship with him , as all seemingly viable alternatives seem to be worse .
In February , China’s dollar-denominated exports declined unexpectedly , while imports rose sharply , causing China’s first monthly “trade reversal” since early 2014 .

Last month , David Burton , the Asia-Pacific director of the <international_monetary_fund> (IMF), politely told the Singapore Press Club that the root of the <asian_financial_crisis> lies in “the weaknesses in the financial and corporate sectors that did not fully emerge at the time .” In a series of more candid reports for the <asian_development_bank> (ADB), economists called for improved governance and described corruption in Indonesia and the Philippines as “a profound obstacle to progress .”* The report noted that in the five countries hit hardest by the <financial_crisis> , average <annual_growth> fell 2 .5 <percentage_points> from pre-crisis levels .
Of these foreign-exchange reserves (such as China’s $2 trillion), only a small part of conventional standards , such as three to four-month import payments or short-term foreign-debt amounts , is part of the US’s gospel – because its debt now resides in the treasuries of cities such as Beijing and Bangkok , but has created some completely inefficient assets in Asia .
The demand sparked protests among shareholders , who believed that the Dutch bank was obstructing the consortium's €720 billion ($99 .7 billion) bid to support a relatively lower bid by British bank Barclays .
The Chinese economy’s <annual_growth_rate> is slowing , from 6 .8 per cent in 2017 to 6 .6 per cent in 2018 , and from 6 per cent to 6 .5 per cent in the expected <target_range> in 2019 .
For a period (actually four years), <hillary_clinton> seems to have dropped the historical burden . As the highest diplomat in the <united_states> , she enjoys the highest personality in the <united_states> at the top of the political ladder . Compared to her popularity overseas , she enjoys appreciation at home for the manner in which <barack_obama> dismissed what he did not want to show .

She has been losing ground ever since . Democrats fear that her plight is a prediction of the future , and they are probably right .
For Sir Fred , the deal is similar to the acquisition of Natwest , which has been under poor management for years . By launching a hostile acquisition , the consortium has been able to avoid confusion in management , enabling the <royal_bank> of Scotland to quickly implement its cost discipline . The deal will extend the capital ratio of the Bank , but the Bank's profitability means that it can recover quickly . Even shareholders seem to support the Bank .
A while ago , I looked at some statistics collected by my colleague Martin Wolf . In 1820 , less than 200 years ago , China accounted for about one-third of <global_output> , India for 16%, and the four European powers for 17%, the <united_states> for less than 2%. By 1950 , the <united_states> had risen to 27%, China to 5%, India to 4%, and the four European powers to 19%.

Of course , the words of praise for the 301 suites admit that if it meets the demands , people will surely love it . So , although I admit that Rome's Residence Napoleon III is one of the best three suites in the world , living here will excite everyone . Its flowery beds and gorgeous interiors are so romantic that they are perfect for spending time with your spouse , partner or lover . In <new_york> , the same is true for Carlyle , LeMeurice in Paris , and Connaught in London .

The Taipei <city_government> has found that over the past three years , a total of about 80 ,000 yuan ($2 .44 million) of the mayor's special fee has been approved by third-party invoicing , which is done by tricking in on unrelated large invoices to replace numerous small invoices for newspapers , tea and fruit purchased for the mayor's office . "None of this money goes into the mayor's personal wallet ," said Mr . Li , the Taipei City Secretary-General .
The first problem is the lack of relevant economic theories . Compared to the overwhelming literature on <interest_rates> , we know little about the transmission channels , delays , and ultimately the effects on the economy and distribution of these unconventional tools , some of which were the standard tools of the '50s and '60s , but unfortunately economic history has been forgotten and , in any case , the world has changed since then . It is dangerous for policymakers to rely on economic models to predict the effects of different policy options without strong support from empirical studies .

Mr Shevchenko said he believes the recent Chinese <state_council> decision to monitor the excessively fast rise in the price of "food necessities" and to control "energy prices" will begin to curb consumption prices . "In 2008 , our prices are indeed under greater pressure ," he said . "Even if there are no new factors in the <price_rise> , just the impact of the 2007 rise , we are all under greater pressure .
Last December , when almost all the major <asset_classes> fell , marked a year that investors must have longed to forget . 2018’s marked volatility sets some key challenges for 2019’s markets .

Anti-Americanism will not vanish suddenly miraculously , but its existence will be harder , and it will be forced to correct its sell-off rhetoric . Will there be a global shock wave ? Another Roosevelt administration , a geopolitical new administration ? There is something certain that the new president will feel overwhelmed by the burden of history : never before have American elections provoked such fervent but rational hope in other parts of the world .
The root of the problem lies in the lack of flexibility in China's <exchange_rate> mechanism , which hampers economic governance in many ways : demands that <interest_rates> be kept too low to curb the influx of speculative capital ; demands for intervention in <exchange_rates> , thereby generating <monetary_stimulus> ; and , as long as such a mechanism maintains the undervalued renminbi , it encourages excessive investment in export-oriented manufacturing , thereby increasing China's <trade_surplus> .
"Many Swiss bankers just tell their clients to transfer money to other secret accounts ," says David Garvin , Miami tax attorney for account holders . "The U .S . government has made it clear that it will be looking into all the banks it knows have problems .

One of Russia's most exciting developments is the growth of domestic consumers , driven by confidence re-established within the country , said Robin Geffen , manager of NeptuneRussia and GreaterRussia Fund . "The consumption patterns are in a hierarchy : living in the <city_centre> , eager to buy <luxury_goods> from the <middle_class> , while the spending of the <bottom_line> is growing , as low-income consumers join the <middle_class> for the first time and are able to afford more basic household goods , especially in the periphery of <major_cities> ," he said .

It was only later that human activities became the subjects of research in different disciplines of science . This was to some extent the result of the necessary specialization in any field that occurred in the course of the advancement of knowledge .

For JPMorgan <chief_executive> <jamie_dimon> , who manages more than $2 trillion in assets , the exercise of a 50% stake in Cazenove is merely a business composite .

The question is how much the proposed action will cost . In this respect , the report's conclusions are quite encouraging . The economic cost of reducing the rate of growth in <greenhouse_gas_emissions> seems reasonable . The report estimates that , although there are many uncertainties , this cost accounts for only 1% of <global_output> , equivalent to just a few months of <economic_growth> .
After all , China has declared that if Taiwan declares independence , it will resolve it by force . In the latter half of the twentieth century , China fought military conflicts with India , the <soviet_union> , and Vietnam . Beijing has <raised_concerns> about secrecy in military expenditures .

If Japan raises no doubts about its determination to protect the <united_states> , it will develop <nuclear_weapons> , thereby triggering a regional <arms_race> .
These moves can only further strengthen the impression that many people have had for some time : attacking network activity , whether involving espionage or destruction of infrastructure , is now one of the world's greatest security threats .

One day , one country may wage a network war against another , paralyzing the country's infrastructure .

The <bad_news> may be that , even if other indicators currently measuring China’s impact on <global_demand> (such as base metal prices) seem to be on the rise , confidence in China’s driving <global_economic_growth> is still growing . In fact , the consequences could be severe if China (not necessarily the stock market) does not meet these high expectations .
If things can’t go on forever , they will . The question is how long <donald_trump> will last . It doesn’t make any sense to speculate for the next four years . Multiply it by the first four weeks of Trump’s presidency and ask how long the US system can hold on .

At about 5 :00 p .m . on the first day , I had learned all about the horrors of working-class life . School had made me accustomed to the monotonous daily life , but at least I left school in the afternoon . In the office , which was in January , it had been dark for a long time , and in the room without even a window , my new colleagues were still typing on the computer . Their bodies and skin had changed all day sitting under the fluorescent lights . One day , I realized that I was going to be them too .

However , Martin’s focus on unilateral saving adjustments in China (or , I would add , other high-saving economies such as Japan) is wrong .

At the time of the new generation of generators , the steam engines were removed and replaced by generators . There was little increase in productivity .

As early as the early 1950s , Miller , like many psychologists and neuroscientists , was fascinated with the question of how the brain stores information . Before that , many scientists believed that memory was inherently different . However , Miller believed that there was a more fundamental pattern in this .

This cap was usually between 5 and 9 data points , with the average being "magic number 7 ."

"We're at a crossroads ," said Lian JyeSu , chief analyst at the <consulting_firm> .

Lord Palmerston said in 1841 that "Hong Kong is a barren island without a house - it will never become a centre of trade ." That statement has proved to be completely wrong .

The company is expanding internationally and has introduced a new production line to produce slippers that don't have sliding wheels . But I don't care about that .

Can the economy return to normal after the snow has melted ? Clearly , the worst winter weather in 50 years has cost people a price , but this also reveals the flaws in China's government's <energy_policy> . Input <market_forces> and the central planned economy's price constraints have tied up power producers' hands . The interruptions in supply in major markets such as Australia and <south_africa> have exacerbated <global_demand> tensions , pushing <coal_prices> to <record_highs> . Although domestic production has so far been able to meet most of China's demand , local <coal_prices> are also rising – only in a much smaller range . About 80% of China's electricity comes from coal-fired <power_plants> , so the rise in <coal_prices> will immediately affect profitability . Citigroup noted that independent listed power producers used between 65% and 95% of their coal consumption this year at contract prices , up 10% on average from last year .

For example , if you are an experienced multiplayer gamer , a reasonable choice is to buy a desktop computer with an upgraded flash card or a faster memory slot instead of a laptop that is difficult to upgrade .

The new measures will enable all <high_school> graduates to speak English fluently , <mr_lee> said . Although many Koreans have spent more than 10 years learning English at school , it is still difficult for many to communicate with foreigners . Part of the reason is that Korean and English are very different in pronunciation , grammar and tone , but more importantly , public schools focus on grammar and reading skills and lack oral education . A 2003 report by the Hong Kong-based political economic risk <consulting_firm> Politicaland Economic Risk Consultancy found that Koreans had the lowest levels of English communicative skills in 12 countries in <east_asia> .

Of course , the decline in the renminbi had too little direct impact on U .S . and European inflation and on <economic_activity> (even if it fell by 10%) to explain the <sharp_decline> in both <bond_yields> and inflation indicators .The renminbi has a weight of about 20% in the trade-weighted dollar and euro , which , in general , can reduce inflation and real <gdp_growth> by between 0 .5% and 0 .6% in 18 months when the trade-weighted dollar and euro rise by 10%, so that , under other conditions , even if the renminbi depreciates by 10%, the impact is merely to lower U .S . and European inflation levels and <economic_growth> by 10 to 20 base points in a year .

Mrs . Sacher is not the most successful Conservative <prime_minister> of the twentieth century , for the simple reason that the shopkeeper's daughter is not a nominal member of the <conservative_party> .

Why is that ? Some people are unable to keep secrets , and revealing things they don't know will excite them , even if it damages the company they belong to .

In my experience , you usually know who is a leaker , but it is almost impossible to prove it . Others are open-minded : they gain journalists' approval by leaking secrets , or they take advantage of them , or they win out in some internal disputes . Of course , companies will deliberately pre-empt publicity so that official statements are watered down .

Moreover , as the situation unfolds , it is easy to ignore the advances that have been initiated by Prince : greater benefits from the size and portfolio of Citigroup -- even though some work (such as cost-cutting plans) could have started earlier .But there is no doubt that investors owe a convincing argument : Why is the achievement that Citigroup has been able to achieve far beyond what it has actually achieved so far ?

For example , trials may prove that hiring trained nurses can be beneficial to people's health . But spending large amounts of money on training nurses may force skilled people to give up other important jobs , such as education or even , I think , starting a business .

All types of off-balance-sheet loans and collateral platforms (i .e . pipeline and structural investment instruments (SIVs)) have been linked and are finding it difficult to obtain short-term financing to sustain their operations . Banks that support them should have intervened , providing so-called liquidity arrangements to support them , but those banks , too eager to reduce <credit_risk> , are trying to stay out of the game .

It might sound very basic , but think about how many times we're doing so much at the same time , and we're absent . By keeping an eye on what's going on , you can overcome this bug ," Goldman said .

Most of the large <listed_companies> are owned by extremely dispersed shareholders . Most of us have pensions and insurance , through which we all invest in stocks ; everyone owns them , but no one really owns them . No owner has control , so the people employed become owners .

It is hard to imagine which cohesive economic group lacks the most appropriate foundations . The members of APEC are quite different geographically and economically : as the richest and poorest members of the organization , the per capita economy of the <united_states> is almost 70 times that of Vietnam .

The situation is even worse outside OPEC , where <oil_companies> , <despite_recent> successes in Brazil , find new oil fields so difficult that their stocks are shrinking . <analysts_say> non-OPEC production has reached peak this year and will never increase .

China has not released a full set of <current_account> and <capital_account> data for the <first_quarter> of this year . Foreign exchange reserve data have thus become the best analytical alternative .

The exact timing is uncertain , but economists estimate that as much as $10 billion may have been transferred to <china_investment_corp> in the <first_quarter> .

Simply from a technical point of view , the problem lies in the coordination of the relationship between controlling pests and protecting water resources . Farmers have carefully exploited the 170 tiny streams that flow on the sacred volcanic slopes of Bali . They have protected water resources through the simplest method - subak , which is to divide the ladders into different "irrigation units". The opposite is true of controlling pests - it is better to have the entire ladders shut down at the same time , so that the pests die of starvation . In an ideal situation , we can make a breakthrough , formulate a complex regional rotation plan , and adjust it constantly . In such a system , a self-employed farmer may be burdened by many people , so a unified rotation plan must be reached (or implemented). After the introduction of new rice varieties , the government has concentrated on coordinating rice cultivation , and the new rotation system has failed .

Shinzo Abe , the <prime_minister> of Japan , is a firm believer , but nevertheless , when yesterday’s news came out that Japan’s fourth-quarter economic year-on-year growth in 2013 was only 1%, less than half what <analysts_expected> , he must have had a moment of self-doubt . Some would have regarded these disappointing figures as a sign of Abenomics’s departure , a judgment that may be overly forceful , but that Abe and Japanese businesses must act quickly to stop the <economic_recovery> from stalling . Abenomics is a package of fiscal , monetary , and supply-side policies proposed by Abe .
Maybe you don't understand why the FSA's perfectly reasonable demands are so unsettling , and listen to me . This hit me straight in the gut : fear of being caught . This fear has not wavered throughout my career ; it hasn't disappeared as I've grown older , but month after month , because it hasn't been caught , it feels a little weakened . I almost believe I've gotten rid of this fear forever .

Sadly , in the <united_states> , this principled debate is intertwined with another almost surreal debate about deficits that is taking place before bond and foreign-exchange traders , which , in the short term , creates the risk of defaulting on the world’s safest securities .

Crises and catastrophes are the source of filmmaking , and they have been emerging over the years since the <financial_crisis> broke out .But what should directors do when <economic_recovery> , however slow , becomes a news topic that is no news (not to mention drama)?When one sees Woody Allen as the financial swindler (played by Alex Baldwin) in his well-received new film Blue Jasmine , one is inevitably nostalgic—the character is like the last swallow on a summer day , perhaps preparing to follow his companion to a warmer area .

In doing so , they are also helping Europe . If the dollar continues to fall and the <asian_central_banks> squeeze their own currencies , the burden of adjustment will be borne by the euro as a whole .

But at the top of the economy and education ladder , things are different : economists Peter Kuhn and Fernando Lozano find that paid tech workers are increasingly likely to spend more than 50 hours a week at major jobs . <financial_times> readers who think they work harder than the previous generation may be right . Kuhn and Lozano find that , because of the culture of long-term work (whether that culture makes sense or not), tech men work longer because they do so for much higher pay in the long run .

Indeed , the uncertainty about next year’s emissions is not so worrying , because “climate change” is not caused by what will happen next year , but by the cumulative accumulation of emissions since the <industrial_revolution> .

The answer may be in the name (of course , the name derives from Pecker's own series of comic books) "America's Glory" is undoubtedly derived from F . Scott Fitzgerald . On page 113 of my edition of TenderistheNight , I find these words : "In the years after the French war , generous settlements took place under the protection of America's Glory ..." Fitzgerald is obsessed with describing the characteristics of Americans , good or bad (as "there is no second action in American life"), and he sees the glory as the endless , inevitable legacy that his country has left to the world . Even in the midst of destruction and deprivation , this legacy will continue .
But it is getting harder and harder to offset the $50 billion a year in "exchange" reserve growth (which is the only one in economic history), and the rapid growth of <bank_loans> is more of a catalyst for the <stock_market> .The <chinese_authorities> have more options : easing capital outflow restrictions , opening up <domestic_markets> , and placing more state-owned companies on the <stock_market> to increase stock supply .

Commercial-street property has been hit hardest , according to data from Savills First , a <real_estate> professional that said in October that rents on three-year commercial-street property fell 30 to 40 per cent year-on-year . Nevertheless , shopping mall-type property (which is generally favoured by Hong Kong's major listed <real_estate> companies) has been relatively resistant to decline . Commercial-street shops' rents have risen by 2 per cent , owing to high leasing rates driven by the psychology of "fighting for safety ." <consumer_sentiment> and tensions in Hong Kong's relationship with the Mainland appear to indicate that the situation may worsen .

This autumn and winter , men's designers seem to be struggling to launch their own coat series ; perhaps they are also aware that , with <global_warming> , the seasons are no longer so clear , and that new coats need to show more connotations , not just to meet the need for warming .T-plates are full of T-shirts , coarse fabric coats and jackets , and of course classic thick and short coats , all inspired by military clothing , so what's the choice ?

If you are busy thinking of Stephen as a stoat or a snake , how can you simultaneously get your mind going and talk about outsourcing or corporate <social_responsibility> issues ? Even if you are sure he is a squirrel , how can you prevent him from being called Simon or Sebastian the next time you meet him ?
The second difference is the geographical distribution of the crisis . The <western_world> was the first to be the source of the shock . In Washington , <new_york> , and Paris , the "financial crisis" has always been something that happened to others , such as <latin_america> , Asia , and Russia .

In 2000 , Al Gore , who was an economic nationalist , ran for president . It is hard to believe that in 2004 , <john_kerry> , too , ran in this manner . Raising the <minimum_wage> (the Republicans are foolish and did not campaign on this issue) is a typical populist position .
How did all this happen ? I think a central source , or what can be called the &ldquo terrifying rise of the markets&ldquo .

China has saved about half of its annual output . The "financial system" that mediates these resources is dominated by unscrupulous <banking_systems> , which have been misdirected into ineffective investments that represent rapidly declining productivity , barely creating a lot of jobs , and causing enormous waste .

The <chinese_government> has warned that bilateral relations between Germany and Germany could continue to be affected unless Germany takes measures to repair the damaged “political atmosphere ,” namely when <german_chancellor_angela_merkel> met with the <exiled_tibetan_spiritual_leader> <dalai_lama> in September this year .

The idea of oil as a weapon reminds us of the 1973 Arab oil embargo , when <oil_prices> rose three times overnight in the largest energy-consuming regions – the <united_states> , Europe , and Japan – and gas stations lined up . The oil embargo caused the industrialized world to be in a state of turmoil , and they set up the <international_energy_agency> (IEA) to protect the security of <oil_supplies> , making it even more difficult for a few <oil_producers> to take on supplies to threaten the <global_economy> .
The police rejected Ms . Zhang and other citizens in the precinct . The precinct is in an old district near <tiananmen_square> . They said officials illegally demolished their homes in order to clear the way for a project expected to be acquired by SOHO China , a developer listed in <hong_kong> .

Nevertheless , the absolute number of emerging-market credits entering the market in dollars is worrying . According to <merrill_lynch> , last year's total issuance exceeded a staggering $29 .2 billion in 2012 and is likely to rise further this year . Emerging-market enterprises are attracted by the <low_interest_rates> offered by the market , especially if they are able to lock down <lower_interest_rates> in the long term .
For a long time , European policymakers have been privately anxious about the value of the renminbi , but they have taken a soft and gentle approach in public , compared to the high-pitched actions of US leaders . Europeans clearly believe that public demands (renminbi appreciation) are difficult to accept by the <chinese_authorities> , especially in Beijing , where the renminbi appreciation is in the interests of the other country .
Individual investors have shown a similar tendency , turning their funds to offshore markets and keeping them there . Analysts also believe that restrictions on Taiwan's connections to the mainland are at least partly to blame . First , the Taiwanese government has banned the sale in the island of "common funds" that invest only small amounts in mainland-related stocks . Second , the 40 per cent requirement prevents companies from listing in Taiwan to <raise_capital> for expansion in the mainland , allowing Taiwanese investors hoping to share the continent's <economic_growth> to turn to offshore markets .
<analysts_say> the current slight interference reflects Beijing's satisfaction with the moderate depreciation of the renminbi , which could partly offset the impact of tariffs on the price of <chinese_goods> in dollars .In 2018 , the renminbi fell 6 .3% against the dollar , and the renminbi fell 2 .6% against a basket of trade-weighted currencies .

China accounts for 21 per cent of the world's population , but only 9 per cent of the world's arable land area , and water resources are below the world average and poorly distributed , and China is no longer able to provide itself with livestock feed .
But shareholders , as well as spectators , are easily confused , and <chief_executives> are often judged on quarterly performance . Investors are often lacking patience . Facebook , for example , has been sold , partly because the company has increased its capital expenditures to build a sustainable business , and last quarter its ratio of capital expenditures to sales reached 35%. <mark_zuckerberg> could cut capital expenditures substantially to boost short-term profits .
Global elites are increasingly worried that history will repeat itself .The <world_economic_forum> (WEF) released its annual survey results on Wednesday , revealing the main concerns of its members .

Restricting <foreign_investment> in China's economy will place China's government increasingly under the control of domestic beneficiaries who are opposed to competition and change . <deng_xiaoping> , the first <chinese_leader> to take on the market role , pointed out that reform and openness are equally important components of policy . Now , <hu_jintao> and China's current government should begin to put this idea more actively into practice .

During the "July Crisis" of 1914 , he continued to spend long weekends in the countryside . Three days before the outbreak of the <first_world_war> , he was still hesitant about whether Britain should join the war . He almost never bothered Cabinet members to discuss it . Eventually , Britain was unwittingly plunged into a catastrophic war . Writer Andrew Adonis , a Labour member , called him "the most incompetent <foreign_minister> in history ," but neither Lord Halifax of the 1930s and George Brown of the 1960s were equal to him .

In the latest developments in the complex relationship between humans and automation and automation , Foxconn is the main protagonist .The Taiwanese company manufactures the Apple iPad , the most popular , science-fiction-like product of the "chattering classes ," who in the West like to talk about politics and social problems , and produces equipment for Nokia and Sony .Foxconn employs one million people in China .Last year , after a series of workers suicides at Foxconn's Shenzhen factory , people began to focus on the pressures faced by low-income young workers , and Foxconn became the focus .In short , Foxconn is a window through which iPad users can learn about the personnel struggles and management difficulties that have been plagued by events in the <developed_world> for decades .

A recent <survey_found> that 30 percent of job seekers in their resumes either faked or fabricated facts , which shocked me . Could this figure be so low ? I used to believe that the resumes were full of evasive , half-truths and half-truths . As a skeptic , the fact that 70 percent of employees were being honest shakes my lack of confidence in human beings . The only thing that comforts me is that people often tell little lies in anonymous surveys , just like they do in their resumes , which means that the real percentage may be higher .

Not only will the <stock_market> plunge lead to a failure of corporate financing plans , but it may also lead the government to face <political_opposition> from dissatisfied investors , who will point to the government's <dominant_position> in the market – the state being the regulator , deciding how many new shares are issued , holding the majority of stockholders and holding the majority of <listed_companies> , and even the majority of existing banks owned by the government .
The blame for this is undoubtedly Wall Street's panic .As the <credit_crunch> forces acquisitions and other transactions to cease gradually and leaves most major investment firms struggling , <new_york> estimates that this year's bonuses are expected to shrink by 21 per cent , with the <financial_sector> having suffered more than $400 billion in losses over the past year and laid off tens of thousands of people , forcing most of them to leave the <property_market> .
Some leading economists point out that China’s massive “stimulus package” has exacerbated structural imbalances in the economy , possibly delaying China’s transition to a more <sustainable_growth> model .
It is unrealistic to think that the power shortage will drive China to reduce domestic production and increase imports . The impact on the energy-intensive aluminum industry is particularly severe : large producers have reduced production by as much as 10% this month , but stocks are still sufficient and China has not turned to imports . China's slowdown will hit global commodity demand to some extent , but more importantly , China is reluctant to pay for exactly what it helps to push prices up .
As the global <smartphone_market> slows , the world's largest electronics replacement maker , Foxconn , is entering industrial technologies such as automation of processes for other manufacturers , known as the main supplier of Apple's iPhone .

Yesterday's fall in Shanghai also brought down US and European stocks , with investors worried that any rebounds in China's <economic_recovery> would drag other economies out of the world's worst <economic_crisis> since the 1930s .
For me personally , the most annoying thing is that nobody plays chess . My dad taught me to play international chess , and I've gradually fallen in love with it . But nobody plays chess in school , and joining a chess club or a league doesn't make any sense--you always think of the situation : a chess player who's nervous about the game meets a chess player who hasn't seen a chess game before , and he's busy writing recipes . So I just have to go around asking for chess , sometimes persuading my friends to bring them out . Even so , if you put up a chess board in a British bar , you'll get other drinkers to look at it , as if you were saying , "Oh , you're going to play chess again ?"
But he added that the <central_bank> was under pressure after the unexpected deflation in November last year -- which actually raised <real_interest_rates> .
Then came the recession in 2014 , when <steel_production> across China more than doubled in a decade , supply far exceeded demand , and the cyclical downturn in the <real_estate_market> caused <steel_prices> to plummet so much that some varieties became as cheap as white rice .

Obviously , the advantage of the <hong_kong> Graduate School of Commerce lies in its founding philosophy : to build a cutting-edge institute employing only teachers with an international professional background .

ToyRUs will close or sell all its stores in the <united_states> , and its downfall is destined to further hand power over to major retailers such as Amazon and Walmart .
Greece could gain a temporary "competitive advantage" from the massive depreciation of the new economy , but , like Portugal , Spain , and Italy , Greece does not have lasting nominal rigidity , and thus cannot sustain this temporary "competitive advantage ." Soaring wages and high corporate prices will re-emerge in today's lack of competitiveness .
These concerns apply equally to Lehman Brothers . But the <us_government> does not have endless resources ; even if it does , it is the right choice to lay the groundwork for the challenge of a serious financial panic . If it paralyzes mortgage institutions like房利美 , the <us_economy> is likely to collapse .

Last November , China's second-largest <real_estate> agency , China Ten Estate , shut down most of its stores due to reports that the company's <chief_executive> had fled . <analysts_say> it is not surprising that China's southern <real_estate_market> has been hit hardest , in part because of its proximity to <hong_kong> , where the number of speculative buyers is far higher than in any other region outside Shanghai .

The <shanghai_stock_exchange> (SSE) is carefully considering the possibility of listing itself . Despite a massive fall last week , the renminbi-denominated A <stock_market> has grown more than twice in the past 12 months , and , as the <first_public> IPO by Heian Insurance showed after the crash , the <local_market> is far from meeting the demand for domestic firms' IPOs .

Many private universities , which are closely linked to the industry , are more responsive to the evolution of the <labour_market> and implement a skill-based curriculum .

Few elections with so few voters can bring so much joy to so many people . A committee composed of just 1 ,200 of Hong Kong's most distinguished and (not necessarily) best people will decide who will be the next <chief_executive> of the <special_administrative_region> (in fact , the mayor). However , this has not prevented the people of <hong_kong> who are pushing for universal suffrage by 2017 from treating the election as if it were a real one .

The company , which is more focused on the Chinese liquor market than other competitors , expects a market gain of 24 times , compared to 18 and 17 times for Diageo and Pernod-Ricard , respectively . If there is no worse news from China , the company should be able to maintain this gap with its rivals . However , there is little room for a rise in the company's earnings ratings . As its shares showed in autumn , there is plenty of room for a fall if Chinese decide to switch to other liquors .
According to <chinese_media> reports , the <personal_computer> maker is cutting staff and adjusting its management . One of the reasons that Lenovo has never really delivered on its promise of a strong fusion of world-famous brands (IBM) and low-cost foundations is that it is not only <chinese_companies> that can manufacture computers in China .

Cornelia Tumale is clear that the tiny house in Manila's abandoned government housing project is not suitable for six children .
Many academic studies have shown that China's <interest_rate> levels have little to do with monetary demand . One important reason is that the <commercial_banks> , which still account for three-quarters of the total capital , have excess reserves and are therefore unsensitive to <interest_rates> (as are , of course , state-owned enterprises). Therefore , the <chinese_government> will do its utmost to achieve the goal of <economic_growth> . The key to understanding China's <monetary_policy> is not to sort out the processes of the People's Bank of China , but to understand how China avoids making <economic_growth> lead to social problems .

Combining these two measures will not prevent an economic recession – which has been severely damaged and which has been hurt by recent events – but will shorten the duration of the recession and mitigate its severity . Once the economy returns to normal , banks' minimum <capital_requirements> will be raised again .
Even if Greece successfully raises €300 billion through privatization , meets all the austerity budget targets , and grows at an officially optimistic pace , by 2014 , its <government_debt> will still be equivalent to 150 per cent of <economic_output> , and most of Greece’s outstanding debt will be in the hands of the <public_sector> (European governments , the ECB , and the IMF) – an estimated priority – so that the remaining private-sector “owners” will be forced to bear a greater share of the losses – a worrying prospect for Europe’s “financial system ,” which is why all parties are trying to avoid defaults on <greek_debt> .
When asked recently what kind of people would be chairing the Fed , <us_president_barack_obama> responded that they would promote <economic_growth> while curbing inflation and ensuring that <financial_markets> did not create new instability .I think this clearly explains what kind of <fed_chairman> we need and sums up very well why current Vice-President <janet_yellen> is the right choice .

China's National Intelligence Law , especially Article 7 on the obligation of "Chinese citizens" to support the work of national intelligence , is often misread . Firstly , it does not authorize first-time agents to spy on intelligence activities ; the work of national intelligence must be defensive in nature . Secondly , it requires <intelligence_agencies> to respect the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and institutions , including Huawei . Furthermore , it is not yet clear whether China has any incentive to require Huawei , a globally recognized Chinese brand , to engage in espionage activities at the expense of its future .
Allowing speculation would not do China any good . Of course , foreigners who can only buy H shares would have to raise more money when buying them , but in turn , the ability of <listed_companies> to raise cheap capital at home would be weakened . This is important when a number of <listed_companies> are waiting for a "return" to the <shanghai_stock_market> , such as PetroChina , which plans to raise up to $100 billion . If speculation were possible , it would not only not cool the A <stock_market> far enough , but it could only further raise <share_prices> in <hong_kong> . China has been conservative in allowing domestic <capital_outflows> and pushing for <joint_ventures> investing in overseas securities -- four of which have so far raised $160 billion , while the other four are on hold .

"Citizens are much more aware of this now ," adds Albert Lai , chairman of the HongKong People's Council for Sustainable Development , a non-governmental organization , and an important opponent of the demolition of the pier .

Moreover , if potential investors complain that companies listed in Shanghai are under-capitalized and hampering their investment intentions , they are also unclear . High dividend rates will not make Chinese stocks more valuable . Perhaps potential investors are concerned that companies are unable to properly invest in their own capital . That is also true . But the decision on how to spend profits should be made by current shareholders , not by regulators . Moreover , China is still a <emerging_market> , so it can be said that saving profits is more valuable if they are used to finance growth-oriented capital expenditures than is the case with dividends . For the past five years , the average rate of payment of dividends to companies such as <real_estate> developers , PolyRealEstate , has reached 60 per cent , not to mention how fast China is urbanizing . In fact , the average dividend rate for companies listed in Shanghai is about 30 per cent , which is equivalent to that for companies on the S&P 500 , whereas the SP500 represents mature markets .

Many of the positions I've worked in are less attractive to my senior colleagues , but there's one that sounds more important to me . For example , the company's liquidity manager sounds more attractive to me , but it's a low-level position , with only one subordinate . Would the recruitment manager take a look at my title and throw my resume straight into the trashcan ?

The censors quickly took action , removing Xu Zhaolong's widely spread article from <social_media> platforms and websites . He only implicitly criticized the Belt and Road corridor , and until early August , it was clear that criticism of the Belt and Road corridor was sufficient to provoke official retaliation .

Department of Commerce to measure consumer spending) grew by 2 per cent year-on-year , roughly equivalent to the level at the end of last quarter , but up by 1 .9 per cent year-on-year .However , this moderate growth is too weak compared to the recovery in <consumer_spending> after previous recessions .
"The government has come to the conclusion that it is very likely that Russia is responsible for the actions against Sergei Skripal and Julia Skripal ," she said , citing the police's more than week-long investigation into the crime scene and the statements of biological experts from the British military's <research_centre> for <chemical_weapons> at PortonDown .

The ECB’s intervention is at the bottom of analysts’ expectations , but it is already a breakthrough for the euro’s “guardian .” The ECB has previously avoided direct purchases of <sovereign_debt> .
What really upsets me is that there are now more and more unpleasant rhetoric and pseudo-scientific analyses packed in digital packets . Take Barclays , for example , whose <consulting_firm> , Pirc , complained to shareholders a few days ago that Barclays's pay-making system is too complicated to recommend voting against the pay agreement at the second week's meeting .
"Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda and I believe that Sino-Japanese relations are at a new historical starting point ," said China's <president_hu_jintao> , on his first visit to Japan in 10 years and the second in history .
For a long time , corporate giants such as Odebrecht have been active overseas , but mainly in <latin_america> . Globally speaking , Portuguese-speaking imperialism is more popular with companies such as Vale and JBS , the world's largest meat-producing group . Brazilian banks , such as Itaú-Unibanco , the world's eighth-highest-marketed bank , have been following these clients into <overseas_markets> , all of which are well-known brokers and globally active stock and bond issuers .

At the same time , bold <foreign_investors> may continue to remain "flushed": so far , they have performed very well on the <chinese_stock_market> . Some self-deceiving investors believe that buying Chinese companies' shares is a shared miracle of China's <economic_growth> , but they may be woken up to the cruel reality someday .
A new trend is emerging in the management community . There is no name for this trend , so I'm going to call it the "black is white" trend , because it's characterized by saying that what everyone thinks is bad is good (or vice versa).
On Tuesday , the chairman of China’s largest private-sector firm praised the “miraculous” American stainless steel giant and proposed a plan to attract one million US small businesses to Alibaba’s platform over the next five years , part of a plan he and Trump devised in January .
Newman said , "The balance is largely maintained , but the <south_korean> authorities have been very concerned about the foreign payments system , despite the fact that for some time South Korea's trade has been surplus , but they still feel it is necessary to maintain the surplus .
When we try to do so , the ones that scare us most are always authoritarian dictatorships (and many of the most unstable commentators have done so since <donald_trump> became President of the <united_states> , including the moderate conservative David Frum).In a typical anti-Utopian scenario , Trump is in his third term after two presidencies , ruling Britain by conservatives hostile to foreigners or socialists hostile to <property_rights> (depending on what your worst nightmare is), and France finally revived the National Front .
Some senior Russian officials have voiced dissatisfaction with the deal to replace President Dmitri Medvedev and <prime_minister_vladimir_putin> next year .
Washington’s anti-China sentiment is not limited to the open and undifferentiated protectionist government of <donald_trump> (CFIUS officials appointed by the president), a sentiment shared by both parties , and that has formed during former <president_barack> Obama’s presidency , when the <obama_administration> blocked Chinese acquisitions of the German semiconductor-equipment maker Aixtron .
This month's <market_turmoil> highlighted this danger .The <european_bank> for Reconstruction and Development , a multilateral bank in Europe , estimates that the <banking_sector> will need $20 billion in refinancing this year and $10 billion to $15 billion in investments to deal with <bad_debt> .The question is how much of the money on these loan accounts will become <bad_debt> as <economic_growth> slows in the <major_economies> , plus currency depreciation .
The Bestseller Code , written by <stanford_university> scholars Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers , is the latest attempt to challenge conventional computer algorithms – this time to analyze the elements needed for a book to win the <new_york_times> best-selling novels list .
"In principle , there is no discrimination against investments from China and India does not intend to do so ," said Ashwani Kumar , India's Minister of Labour and Commerce . "But every country has the right to scrutinize more carefully when there is a security problem , and only when there is a security problem is the <indian_government> going to scrutinize more carefully .
Kim Jong-un is often feared or ridiculed in the outside world , but apart from his love of murdering relatives and testing <nuclear_weapons> , what else does the fat <north_korean_dictator> have in mind ? Is he a secret reformer who actually intends to abandon <nuclear_weapons> and achieve peace ?
A <senior_official> of the <international_monetary_fund> (IMF) told the <financial_times> that when two elephants fight , they will trample on the grass .
I admire the International Settlements Bank (BIS). It is courageous to blame its owners - several of the world's leading <central_banks> - for their incapacity . But the BIS has done so , most recently in its latest <annual_report> . It is easy to think of it as a bullshit for the prophets of the end , but it is wrong to do so . Whether you agree with the BIS's retention of macroeconomic policy thinking prior to the 1930s , it raises a number of big questions .
The question is whether Obama will recognize this opportunity at the forthcoming G20 meeting , and whether the advice of the old adviser will keep him and the rest of the US trapped in the trap of current economics and strategies .
There was a bronze statue of a horse's head that had been plundered by the Anglo-French Confederacy in 1860 from Beijing's Wenming Garden , guarded by security guards wearing orange sports jackets and gray collars .Beside the horse's head stood a half-figure of the King himself with a slightly slanted eye , which was clearly not intended to be a sarcasm .
Shanghai is a typical example of overcapacity in China's <solar_panel> industry , which has expanded steadily under state subsidies , resulting in severe oversupply after the exhaustion of demand from foreign markets .
Housing collapse or a "government debt" disaster are the most dramatic risks facing China's trust companies , but they are far from likely . China's trust industry is currently most directly concerned that more and more "financial institutions" are entering their markets .
China's "洋快餐" chain may face a disruption in its <supply_chain> , and the departments are stepping up their inspections of a meat supplier whose products are allegedly overdue and misleading fresh products .
In the <third_quarter> of this year , <us_growth> exceeded initial expectations , and a key home-price index exceeded its pre-recession peak , the latest sign that <donald_trump> will inherit a promising economy .
The consequences are twofold : those most in need of credit are denied access to credit (a growing number of reports about small businesses unable to pay their utility bills), and the non-mediation of the formal <banking_system> . The <central_bank> has just started to report its so-called "total social financing", which includes not only net additional <bank_loans> but also trust loans , <corporate_bonds> and equities , and financing from <insurance_companies> . The "fast-track" appears to show that informal financing is growing much faster than formal financing .
Mr McGowan , who has always been a market and economic celebrity , expressed this view in a statement in the Boom , Boomand Doom Report . Mr McGowan was an <investment_banker> at the Drexel Burnham Lambert office in <hong_kong> and now lives in Thailand .

Economists say that to make up for this , these countries must transform themselves into a Western-based economy based on services , where the "financial services" industry will play a major role .
A ghost is plaguing the global <economic_system> . According to research by the <international_monetary_fund> (IMF), “phantom” <foreign_direct_investment> (FDI) currently accounts for 40% of the global FDI stock , with a <total_value> of about $115 trillion . This is equivalent to the sum of China and Germany’s annual “national income ,” but this capital does not work in recipient economies .
Russia’s accession to Western organizations has not produced positive results . Before Russia can act as a mature free-market democracy , the G7+1 cannot become a true G8 . In this regard , there is little reason to be optimistic – <russian_president_vladimir_putin> claims that Russia’s recent protests were well-planned by Western spies , and that he will not be able to attend the latest G8 summit in Camp David due to his busy cabinet (which , of course , is always a complicated task in a sovereign country). Putin’s absence has hardly had an impact on the meeting , as the topics discussed were Afghanistan and the eurozone (where Russia is powerless) and Iran and Syria (where Russia is part of the problem).
A few months ago , Brighton lost one of its earliest clients , Bally .TPG , which controls the shoemaker's <private_equity_group> , decided to sell its shares to the Austrian Labelux group and cancel a 16-year-old distribution agreement with Brighton , a move that has provoked reflection within Brighton .

Many <chinese_media> outlets have reported the story of Wantou Village's Anjia , the village's first to sell homemade grass-grass-making household goods online . This trend has turned Wantou Village into one of the many Taobao Villages of retailer Alibaba , where groups of people sell similar products online , creating a micro-industry . Their activities can stimulate demand for other goods and services and boost the local economy .
The same pattern was observed in the European <stock_markets> , where the FTSE Eurofirst300 had risen by 0 .9 per cent in the previous market , down by 2 .4 per cent in the lowest market , and retreated to 1469 .02 at the end of the day , down by 0 .9 per cent . In the <london_stock> market , the FTSE 100 had gained nearly 200 points , down by 0 .9 per cent at 6116 .0 .
Mr Goodinoff's professional ethics proves that there is a mistake in the often-spoken story that young people are bearing an increasing burden in support of an <ageing_population> . Like Mr Goodinoff , those who might have retired around age 65 are now working longer hours , while young people are not earning money as early as before , but spending more time studying .
This is the first sign in the Asian region that Washington’s debt stalemate is prompting key <financial_institutions> to take measures to protect themselves and their markets when the US defaults .

The long-term solution to the environmental challenge will inevitably require a broad global response . No one believes that it will be possible to achieve this goal without US leadership . As the world's leading economy and one of the largest emitters of <greenhouse_gases> , the US has been a source of concern over its failure to address this challenge seriously . California's leaders have created the best opportunity to change this situation so far , an opportunity we cannot afford to lose .
Cameron's recent support for a bill that would weaken unions and reduce tax exemptions suggests that employment rights are under attack , and many of the rights we get from EU legislation – which brings paid leave , working-time protection , and better maternity and paternity leave – are also under threat .
The criminal prosecution file reads : "The public administration is authorized to continue to hide , rather than to demand disclosure to the U .S . regulators of the mitigation devices ."

The legal currency issue in Scotland has been clarified as follows : there was once a Scotsman who tried to pay the <local_authorities> in Scottish paper money , perhaps in order to demonstrate a point of view , and the <local_authorities> , perhaps in order to demonstrate a point of view , refused to accept the money . The courts allowed both sides not to be foolish . The debt could be repaid only in a manner acceptable to the common-sense people . This is the custom in all places (including Scotland) - perhaps to say the law .
"The proposals in these documents will make it very difficult , if not impossible , for <foreign_companies> to acquire majority ownership ," said a banker who is close to the process , adding that the <net_asset_value> requirement is "confounding" and reflects the proposed rules favouring <chinese_securities> firms .

But this kind of special event is not designed , it’s caused by carelessness . No one can do better than Trump if he really wants to stir up Arab sentiment . That should be a more comforting explanation . Indeed , alienating Palestinians is a side effect . He can’t resist the obscenity of his oversized name appearing on the embassy’s plaque . That’s his love for branding , so he’s prepared to push his agenda recklessly .
"This will lead to the pursuit of quality , so the top business colleges are still developing well , but other colleges are facing rather severe competition . In contrast , the rapidly growing demand for high-quality <business_education> in Asia , China , India and [other] <asian_countries> , will ensure that <business_education> in the region continues to grow for at least decades ," said Professor Xing Jiten .

But what I see in my own neighborhoods highlights that Trump’s clumsy response to the new crop outbreak is part of a larger national problem : policy decisions made over decades have , without exception , tended overall to favour the interests of the “private sector ,” especially large companies , while neglecting the interests of the state and workers , a fact that proves to be hugely damaging to our health and economies .
In 2002 , during the period of "economic improvement ," <north_korea> not only had a state-owned market , but also tolerated the existence of a number of agriculture markets . Since then , agriculture markets have grown nationwide , if not encouraged , with the government's consent . Currently , agriculture markets support North Korea's shaky economy , as the government can provide almost nothing under the quota system .
The Vix index has risen 17 per cent year-on-year , and since it peaked last October , <emerging_markets> have performed at about 12 per cent lower than <developed_markets> , but the dollar trade-weighted index has been at its lowest since October , down 14 per cent year-on-year to 3 per cent since the <greek_debt> crisis last year .

So far , the Greek crisis has brought only the most austerity and the least reform . Fiscal and external adjustments are painful . But the reforms of the political and <economic_system> , which are riddled with cronyism and corruption , are painful . Both have had the worst results . The Greek people have suffered and worked to no avail . They are now poorer than they used to think . Greece has not become more efficient . Now that Greece has been forced out of the eurozone , it seems more likely than ever that a fruitful new agreement will be reached . But it is not too late . Everyone needs to take a deep breath .
The two sides have been arguing over the price of shares , and the <south_korean> Industrial Bank is reluctant to accept the valuation proposed by Dickuld , Lehman's <chief_executive> , according to people familiar with the issue .

The meeting , scheduled for Saturday in Singapore , is therefore a major milestone . However , it raises as many questions as it raises hopes . It is not difficult to see what keeps Beijing focused on Taiwan . Beijing fears that the island of Taiwan , a province in China , may elect a president next January from a pro-independence <democratic_party> (DPC) and that the DPC may also win a majority in the Taiwanese Legislative Assembly . The polls show that both scenarios are more likely to occur , creating Taiwan's most pro-independence political culture in decades .
Being "China's enemy" is an unsettling thing . About 10 years ago , I accidentally entered this role , when I wrote a cover story for The Economist , entitled Containing China .
There are two reasons why <central_banks> have become the focus of attention : First , almost no regulator has anticipated the <financial_crisis> ; and second , almost no government has the room to operate through traditional anti-cyclical <fiscal_stimulus> measures . The United Kingdom is a typical example of a country that continues to run large deficits rather than accumulate surpluses , thereby wasting years of economic stability and growth .
As Bernanke testified to Congress in the <united_states> , he also criticized the use of <financial_instruments> such as <credit_default_swaps> (CDSs) as making the country unstable , or as an “unreasonable” effect of expropriation against the government .A spokesman for the ruling Christian Democratic Union , led by <german_chancellor_angela_merkel> , said that the G20 is discussing whether it is feasible to ban speculative use of CDSs .

According to the plan , China will build a series of LNG yards along the coast , with at least 10 in number , to meet the target of increasing LNG's share of domestic energy from 0 to 8 to 10 per cent in 10 years .

This is Han's first detailed public comment on the corruption investigation , which led to the dismissal of Shanghai's top official , <party_secretary> Chen Liu , last year .
But a series of events unimaginably stirred up his choice . A week ago , a police shooting of the black boy Jacob Blake Jr . in Keynosha , Wisconsin , triggered a wave of protests in the quiet Midwest city of less than 100 ,000 inhabitants . During several nights of riots , buildings were burned down , people shot dead , and clashes broke out between protesters and anti-protesters .

The debate over the future of welfare states has highlighted the weakening of the <middle_class> . For 80 years , the welfare state model has never faced real political challenges . Now , welfare states have hit the “south wall” created by economic realities and <financial_conditions> . Congress , despite passing bills to increase welfare , has no practical means of financing it , and will soon find itself in an unmanageable situation .

Yes , you are right : the so-called "Golden State" of the <united_states> is now spending more resources on imprisoning adults than on educating children , partly because of rising crime rates and voters opposing an increase in school taxes .

I would rather ride in a computer-driven car than in a car driven by a godless man who plays with his cell phone .At the Geneva Motor Show , an automotive executive told a friend of his how he had been seriously injured -- a woman who had been driving while texting and had just come across a crossroads and crashed her friend out of a motorcycle .
In recent months , several capital-stressed provinces have <announced_plans> to cut the cost of government-supported investments .

When the Singapore authorities discuss the environmental risks faced by this low-lying country , the word "survival" appears over and over again .
The deal also highlights China's growing difficulties . Although the company boasted earlier this year that it would seize historic opportunities , it has rarely made a significant deal . Since December last year , it has invested $3 .4 billion in buying some of its zero-star assets : a gas field in Kazakhstan , an oil refinery in Singapore , and taking over a variety of assets from its <parent_company> . Some of the transactions the group is looking at , such as Verenex's Libyan oil assets , or Spain's Repsol YPF , have been stuck for obvious political reasons . The high price of buying Alberta , Canada's province that is expected to produce 3 .5 million barrels a day (1% of the group's current output), is a small consolation .
Perhaps <warren_buffett> has found the answer : not only is he gifted in investment , but he seems to be wise in donations .
Polls after the British <general_election> showed that British citizens had abandoned Gordon Brown's government , and <david_cameron> had crossed 10 Downing Street with one foot , but the Conservatives had not won a majority in the House of Commons .

Writer J .K . Rowling , who recently appeared in <new_york_city> , had two assignments . The first was not surprising : a film based on her novel Fantastic BeastsandWheretoFindThem was released in October , and she and Eddie Redmayne , starring in the film , came to <new_york> to promote the film .

China's growth patterns of reliance on investment , credit-driven stimulus , export focus , and low-cost manufacturing have come to an end , which is clear to even the most optimistic observers . Optimists point out that , due to compound growth , growth of 5 .6 per cent annually over the next five years will be equivalent to 8 .6 per cent annually over the past five years , and 11 .1 per cent annually over the past 10 years . They also point out relevant evidence that as China's growth begins to rely less on mining and more on catering , China is undergoing a long-awaited transition from manufacturing and <heavy_industry> to services and consumption .

Then she took out the ruler . She said the biggest mistake people make on the question of the closet is not measuring the space in the closet correctly . I thought they needed the mattress shelves ("mattress shelves ," Di said , "to occupy space"). Other mistakes included not paying attention to the efficiency of the storage baskets (I always thought they only served as decorations) and being ashamed to seek help . My silk shelves were replaced with stiff , surface-manufactured velvet plastic shelves , the width of which was reduced by about half , and a lot of leaf baskets appeared in the closet , which could just be placed in those small compartments , and they could be pulled out and arranged separately without destroying the entire design . Everything in the closet was marked with color , folded up , tidied up , hung up , just like after the house was decorated . When I stood in front of those tidied up closets that made me excited , I thought : a tidied up closet may not reflect a tidied up brain , but a tidied up category . After all , in the office , the most important things you know how to handle (opening mail , file filing , spending money)--why not at home ? We're all busy drawing the boundaries between public and private , and we haven't come to any conclusion . tidied up files aren't the only things that help you think . tidied up shoes also have the same effect .

Nowadays , English wines are not only refreshing and delicious , but also technologically superior and have a clear taste .(Not always .)Even in oak barrels , oak taste is generally appreciated .The most common drawback of wines is the lack of flavour , probably not due to the cool climate , and in some cases is likely to be associated with overproduction .If there is one variety that cannot be blamed for its lack of flavour , it is the German hybrid grape Ortega , but when it comes to such a large grape , less is absolutely more .The red is often temporary or semi-finished , but there are also some very beautiful pink wines , which are usually dry alcoholic .

Canadian <prime_minister> Stephen Harper says <emerging_economies> must play a greater role in addressing the <global_economy> and <trade_imbalances> that are part of the cause of the <financial_crisis> .
Remember Resolution Trust Corporation , which no longer exists , or Equitas , founded to save Lloyd’s , which has also been acquired by Warren Buffett’s re-insurance business . Usually , “bad banks” designed for political purposes disappear after completion of their mission , whereas China’s first IPO for Cinda has to write a different story to prove that bad banks can last .
The <chinese_president> also proposed a new “double-cycle” economic strategy , which prioritizes the importance of strengthening <domestic_demand> and technological innovation (not closer integration with the outside world).

A woman dressed in a suit - the camera was her back - walked along a corridor toward the end of the sunshine . High-heeled shoes beat the ground , and she gave a strong , firm voice . She passed by two old men who were in the fog . "We'll do it with you ," they shouted . "Don't you take the organization for granted ?" The woman walked straight past . When she reached the end of the corridor , four young men followed her . We never saw her face , because we didn't need to see it .

Since 2008 (including 2016), China’s continuous policy stimulus has prevented the economy from recession on several occasions . This time , China’s fiscal and monetary authorities are no longer taking so decisive action to curb the <economic_downturn> as they prioritize debt deleveraging and improving the quality rather than quantity of <economic_growth> . This self-constraint on the size and nature of recent stimulus plans has led to the latest Chinese forecasts falling below 5%, well below today’s <growth_target> of 6 .0% to 6 .5%. In extreme cases , the authorities may quickly <boost_growth> rates , but this will involve a return to China’s “old” policy .

China and other relevant departments wisely decided to suspend the aircraft .
That's why England loved Cantonner in the 1990s , and that's why his days at Manchester United were the highlight of a very exciting era in football . No sooner than I saw this 51-year-old Frenchman than I discovered that he was still an actor (and , above all , the most important one). On the football field , during his heyday , he could spark the enthusiasm of countless fans every time he touched the ball . Outside the football field , his performance was even more daring--he played the role of the mirror-grabbing French pseudo-philosophers among the savage British .
Last month , in Fortaleza , Brazil , Russia , India , China and <south_africa> , the five BRICS agreed to create a <development_bank> , and they also established a $10 billion currency swap agreement , officially known as the CRA , which would allow <central_banks> to obtain foreign exchange supplies in emergency situations .

Sometimes I think that gene defects are the reason I'm so obsessed with fish . My mother said that when I was still on my way to school , it was hard for me to leave if I saw someone fishing .

In terms of pork production and consumption , the US ranks first , while Wanzhou Group takes the lead in both countries . While global pork consumption may grow slowly , China's per capita consumption base is lower , providing room for faster growth . Moreover , American brands can win over those who are cautious of domestic brands because of <food_safety> concerns . So the potential exists . But first , the company must prove that the transnational deal is effective . Given the industry's regulatory constraints , it will be difficult for <chinese_companies> to manage U .S . food producers . For this reason , the 29 banks listed above should set their prices near the lowest interregional margin . Investors will take risks , and there is naturally room for early rises .

If you are able to withstand the risk that a <stock_market> collapse will have a major impact on your investment , you should only invest in a traditional <hedge_fund> . In this case , <hedge_funds> tend to perform better than other <hedge_funds> , but only slightly better . This is because they can get some extra returns from the purchase rights that have never been exercised , on the other hand , because they tend to prefer "defensive" stocks . These stocks offer high <interest_rates> , and losses are usually smaller than other stocks when the <stock_market> is down .

Will China's automakers grow at full speed in the future ? Not necessarily . Advanced technology remains a problem for domestic automakers . Capacity-building costs are high and will take a long time . In the first half of this year , the company's R&D costs accounted for 2 .2 per cent of sales , compared to 2 per cent last year , and it is building a top-notch test site . Analysts at Bernstein , a <research_company> , believe that R&D investments will rise . But the profitability of Chinese automakers is not the same . Geely Automobile released strong performance data last week , benefiting mainly from large <government_subsidies> . The company and the company appear to have also optimized their own <cash_flow> by shortening dealership payment deadlines . But the future of domestic automakers remains uncertain : China's auto market is still undefined , making it more difficult to predict its future . But at least the rise in profits and improvements in <cash_flow> make it worth studying the Chinese <auto_industry> carefully .

Brazil's capital , Brasilia , which was built over the grasslands 50 years ago , is a hard-to-love city . I don't want to say that when its designer , Oscar Niemeyer , 104 , was sick in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro , but Brasilia is built for cars and architectural critics , not for humans .

How do women work ? From the workplace in my open-plan office area , I can clearly see eight women . The oldest are over 50 , the youngest about 25 . Some people seem to spend some time in front of the mirror before work , while others don't . One person is wearing an oversized horse-tail braid and a bicycle jacket on the back of the chair . The second person is wearing a black dress with a "hate of heaven" on his feet . The third person (myself) has silvery hair and a stain on his trousers . Some people seem to go to the gym regularly , while others seem to have never been to the gym in their entire lives .

Because leaders are always closely watched by their peers , this attention to corporate reputation must begin at the highest level .

Trump’s “diplomatic policy” is still in its infancy . Observing the president-elect and his closest advisers’ public statements shows that it is full of contradictions : on the one hand , proclaiming US isolationism as the first , and on the other , pledging to increase military spending .

Second , ensuring the CEO's influence in selecting directors . Although nobody wants to go back to a time when the CEO could freely form a board and the latter would not challenge it , it is unreasonable to do so without giving the company's chief strategic planner the full say . Today , even value-aware CEOs find that their choice of directors is down to the nomination of the chairman of the board of directors , which leaves them no chance of determining who is in line with their strategic actions . We believe that a mutual veto mechanism between the board of directors and the <chief_executive> can ensure that the board is not a puppet , but rather experts in the ability to develop "challenging partnerships" with the <chief_executive> .

The global <human_resources> manager is doomed to disappoint : in the <foreseeable_future> , this position will remain vacant . <donald_trump> has transformed the <united_states> from an anchor of stability in the <global_economy> into a giant iron sphere of destruction in record-breaking time . But the only two likely candidates to meet this vacancy requirement are China and the <european_union> (EU), each of which has one demand not met . Regardless of what <chinese_president_xi_jinping> has said in Davos , China is determined to take the lead in a range of low-tech and high-tech areas by virtually any necessary means , breaking rules that it considers inconvenient , and , more importantly , preventing new global rules that are emerging from obstructing China from doing so .

Of course , China is not the only country to take such action . The US and other regions , such as the EU , have been tempting foreign firms with access to their own huge consumer markets , and American firms , including GE and Microsoft , have proved to be hurt by repeated manipulations of anti-monopoly institutions .
This slowdown , driven by the US and China , is within the normal monthly fluctuations of global “immediate forecasting ,” and may be only temporary .

At the end of last year , regulators raised the coverage of <bad_loans> to 130 per cent ; now it is reported that it has risen to 150 per cent . At least 37 .5 per cent of loans have been fully guaranteed . Some optimists think better .

It is reported that Trump has asked the Office of the USTrade Representative to draw up a list of unilateral measures against countries such as China , a move that is not surprising but alarming , as the US already has some broader-impact “trade defense” tools , namely anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs .

If bankers take risks and succeed , they will be rewarded , but they will not be punished if they fail .
China's <prime_minister> , Zhou Enlai , has been said to have judged the French Revolution : "It is too early to come to conclusions now ," a long-term view that seems never to be possible .

His newspapers have been supporters of the Japanese <armed_forces> and actively advocate greater influence in Japan's <international_affairs> .
The key to confidence depends on how you define the threats facing the eurozone and whether you believe Sardini . We don't know what he might be thinking . We don't know what he will be thinking when he finally takes office . We know that he may be lying . We know that no politician has ever succeeded in threatening to abolish the euro – his voters' income and deposits are all in the euro . On the other hand , I also have a sceptical attitude towards some people , because they reflect blind optimism about the single currency . If there is a <financial_crisis> , the situation could change rapidly .
But the stronger the euro , the more worrying is the decline in product demand , reflected in a <sharp_drop> in orders , especially in the <automotive_industry> .

The two authors tried to provide a new perspective by incorporating men's views into the book through extensive interviews . They pointed out that "(women's economics) is a business issue , not just a woman's issue" and that by explaining the differences between gender and diversity and explaining in detail the limitations of diversity management , the debate went one step further .

Sony announced it would form a <joint_venture> with China's Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group to produce and sell Sony's PlayStation in China . Last year , the game business did not make any profits , but Sony is the technology leader in the game sector , and there are only two real competitors in the market .

Yes , American stocks now look cheaper , with an expected yield of only 12 times , well below the average of 17 times since 1923 . But when the expected yield was 15 times four months ago , the <stock_market> also seemed attractive . Shares may be falling beyond reasonable limits . But , according to a study by Capital Economics , the stock market's lowest average yield has been 11 times in the past 14 recessions . But , just as the "price" in the yield may sometimes fall too far , profits may fall too . This is precisely what people worry about today : <corporate_profits> are collapsing , and investors are losing hope , believing that the government , the Fed , or anything else is incapable of doing so .
This is certainly true , especially when the situation is rapidly developing or contains ambiguous , unquantifiable details . As <nobel_laureate> economist Friedrich Hayek puts it , “knowing the specific circumstances of time and place” is important , but often neglected .
The scheme is far superior to loans and loan guarantees , the latter being the approach proposed by the <german_government> . Business loans are only intended to survive the crisis for themselves and not necessarily to pay employees . Moreover , loans need to be repaid , which will become a burden on the enterprises after the outbreak . Under the scheme proposed here , non-employment can be a condition of payment to the enterprises . The scheme will come to an end naturally with the outbreak . By then , the government will be able to levy additional taxes to recover their expenses .
Given Trump’s long-standing views of trade , his protectionist commitments during the campaign , and polls showing that his grassroots voters still support him before the mid-November elections , we should take this threat very seriously .
Most of the world's Internet giants are grabbing mobile applications and startups , targeting WhatsApp , AutoNavi and Viber . Sina is doing the opposite . The company has appointed banks to split its Weibo platform . Sina Weibo is a Twitter-like Weibo site on the <chinese_market> . Why does Sina leave the market when other companies are grabbing it ?
The growth , driven mainly by China and the 'developing China', seems to indicate that the world is moving further away from the path set at the landmark <united_nations> conference in Paris two years ago , when countries agreed to limit <global_warming> to no more than 2oC before industrialization , but scientists warned that governments' commitments to emissions reductions since then are insufficient to achieve the overall goal .

But any new contact must be long-term . The challenge now is to get <north_korea> out of its largely self-imposed isolation , which requires a calm appraisal of Kim Jong-il’s 15 years of rule – in fact , no one dared to expect this wise man to undergo an early reflection , and he certainly understands that he has brought <north_korea> into a dead end .

Reconstruction spending can be estimated - Barclays Capital's estimated range is between ¥50 billion and ¥10 trillion ($600 billion to $12 trillion). Without considering the still rising nuclear-related losses , the final amount is likely to be at the bottom of the range . The cost of reconstruction after the 1995 Shinjuku earthquake is ¥10 trillion , and according to <figures_released> by the National Police Agency as of Thursday , the losses should be much smaller this time around : the total number of buildings damaged or collapsed is about 12% of the last earthquake .

Can we dismiss these statements as merely an outburst at the height of the campaign ? Maybe , but we cannot rule out the possibility that politicians , when campaigning , because they are not constrained by the constraints of office , are speaking for the real , or indeed for the real , people in their minds .

On the other hand , it emphasizes its continuity and its relationship with the heritage of thousands of years of imperial rule .

The property of the virtual world's inhabitants should be protected . None of the players who "buy" hotels with virtual money in Monopoly games thinks that they should retain their property at the end of the game .

Is China's government-led <economic_model> really achieved transition arrangement , or is it a further deepening innovation ?

Listing would give a young company credibility , and if a company needed large amounts of capital to invest , or needed a mechanism for early employees to shift mid-term rights , then listing is an important move .

However , most of the restrictions were on supply , and Beijing cut off <bank_lending> to developers . This time , demand has been subject to at least 12 rounds of tightening since late last year .

Today , 10 years later , she started eating ham sandwiches .

My mother always says that everything has to stop .

The Obama administration's plan to address the vulnerability of the <banking_system> is based on two important initiatives .

This bad asset plan involves less than 40% of banks' worth of securities ; it does not involve non-marketable loans of 60% of the Bank's assets .

As Krugman pointed out in his <new_york_times> column , the plan is a third variant of the old bad asset plan , which fits Einstein's definition of "crazy": continuing to do the same thing and expecting different results .

As everything that may be misunderstood will be misunderstood , I must avoid blaming the statement . I am not urging the EU to disintegrate . Like the Holy Roman Empire , the EU may slowly decline for many years without benefit or harm . I am not urging the UK or any other member state to leave the EU . I mean , the EU is no longer worthy of the love of pragmatic idealists . When there is a voice in Paris or Berlin saying that the solution to any problem is "more European", i .e . to strengthen the pluralism of the EU institutions , we should ignore it . When some leaders say , "Without the euro , there will be no Europe ," we should shrug our shoulders , look at the map book , so that we can rest assured .

These banks are relying on occasional staff meetings , and many orders from above to change their behaviour so that the necessary fundamental reforms will not be achieved .

Last week , a financial product sold through the bank's branch network was in trouble , but the bank refused to sell it . The wave of speculation that followed will surely leave the banking stocks more inactive .

I guess , in the workplace , it might be a far too far-reaching social experiment , after all , these benefits are part of their profession . But I don't have to worry about doing a similar experiment at home . Cost Centre One has a monthly allowance , but he has to work for it , and he has to authorize me to write about him whenever and when I want . No wonder he's looking for other ways to make money . If you go to the Henry Royal Regatta this weekend and have a chance to take a frequent look at the "coffee and liquor" that's all around the crew , you may unfortunately get his service . Then you can ask him (as many of you have asked me in the letter) if he's interested in being written about .

Car manufacturers also have no choice but to adapt to the new situation . Cars are the largest durable <consumer_goods> of 20th century civilization . We are moving rapidly from petrol to <electric_cars> and hydrogen cars , both of which will significantly <reduce_carbon_dioxide_emissions> .

Logically , this approach makes sense . In practical operations , both stocks , one of which is priced in convertible currency , are operated simultaneously . There are currently 109 listed B stocks , some 85 of which are also priced in RMB . Repurchase is an option for those companies that own A stocks . Since the average trading price of B stocks is 30% lower than that of A stocks , it may also make sense from a financial point of view . But Chinese firms tend not to repurchase , but rather prefer to invest (or waste) cash in growth opportunities . Moreover , to repurchase B stocks , Chinese firms will have to <raise_capital> in the A <stock_market> – regulators may prefer to avoid this approach , as would large-scale enterprises .
<financial_turmoil> and sustained fall in <asset_prices> are not conducive to boosting consumption . In <dollar_terms> , <commodity_prices> are rising steadily , even in other currencies . This exacerbates inflation , further weakens household <purchasing_power> , and makes <central_banks> more cautious in formulating <monetary_policy> .
Military troops were stationed near streets , television stations and a large pro-government protest site in the suburbs of Bangkok , and the military commander appealed to the parties to maintain calm and insisted that this was not a coup attempt by the Thai military to drive out non-military politicians , which had occurred 18 times since 1932 .

I have always supported the <united_states> . I grew up in the wartime story of American soldiers giving chocolate to their children in liberating European towns . In 1980 , my parents and I , 10 years old at the time , moved from the Netherlands to California and were delighted about it . American houses are bigger than those in a cold , narrow Europe , with better televisions , and Americans can talk to strangers on the streets . Even <ordinary_people> have big houses , and they go down regularly (in 1980 Europe , eating in restaurants was a big thing , only to celebrate grandparents' silver wedding anniversary or when relatives were released from prison).

China's listed stocks are among the world's most expensive , with a market surplus rate of 37 times that of this year . To some extent , it is based on a crazy growth in earnings . The doubling of nominal GDP is indeed a huge driver , but the growth in earnings far exceeds this growth .

The deal , however , puts Wayne Swan , the Australian <finance_minister> with the right to approve and veto , under great pressure .

Labour was forced to wait until other banks with greater solvency – Bank of Communications , <china_construction_bank> (CCB) and Bank of China (BoC) – were listed .
The current situation is particularly tense because there are signs that the shock is spreading from <hedge_funds> to the <banking_system> , as UBS's George Magnus says : "The duration of the bailout is likely to be longer (than expected) and not limited to sub-prime mortgage markets in the <united_states> ... If the current financial situation deteriorates and continues , more pessimistic scenarios must be considered , including the risk of a <hard_landing> ."

The IPO of China's largest bank , the Bank of Commerce and Industry , was the world's largest , attracting more than $50 billion in global subscriptions .

The forecast was made by bankers , producers and analysts attending the London Gold and Silver Markets Association (LBMA) meeting in Berlin , the largest gold industry event . If accurate , it would mean that <gold_prices> would rise by nearly 11% from Tuesday's <record_high> of $1310 .10 per ounce , which would bring huge profits to the world's largest gold miners , such as BarrickGold , NewmontMining and AngloGoldAshanti . Although the attendance of gold miners and investors affected the findings of the London Gold and Silver Markets Association survey , the facts show that the survey's forecasts over the past few years have been accurate and even somewhat conservative .

Culture is not a fancy idea presented in a business book or a self-proclaimed corporate report . It exists as unnoticed but real as the air we breathe . It is a network of heartless mutual understanding that shapes the expectations of each of its members , which determines the fate of all organizations or societies . Bob Diamond , the former <chief_executive> of the notorious Barclays , understands this ; he once claimed that "culture is embodied in the way people act under unsupervised circumstances ." He is right , but he doesn't do what he says .

Western TV channels have been accused of "attitude bias" in their news choices : the West focuses heavily on the victims of <terrorist_attacks> rather than on the millions of people who die in the Democratic Republic of Congo or in the <developing_world> from treatable diseases . Worse still , this bias may mean that the media lacks verification of the relevant decisions and actions of the Western government , such as the <iraq_war> . However , the English-language channel reports far more on domestic events in the "developing China" than CNN and BBC World News , and far less in Europe and the <united_states> than CNN and BBC . As with BBC and CNN , the English-language channel reports more on their home countries (the Middle East) than the other two television channels : the BBC reports more on Europe and CNN reports more on the <united_states> . But the English-language channel reports more on events in parts of the world , such as Sudan , where the media rarely report , partly because it has more opportunities to contact these events .
When we drive our cars , heat our rooms , or use <fossil_fuels> more indirectly , we all generate these costs without paying for them . Thus , we overuse these fuels . This is not a government-planned conclusion , but a market logic : resources without paying are inevitably abused . Even if the government does not need or does not use this part of the income , it can improve the economy by levying a carbon tax and returning it to society .
What interests me is not only the infinite weaknesses of human nature , but also the extent to which technology allows people to tolerate these weaknesses at work .

I grew up in Beijing and left the country at the age of 16 to go to the <united_states> to study <high_school> . Then I went to <harvard_university> to study applied mathematics and economics , and I became very interested in international development .

During that time I worked in <developing_countries> , working with <government_agencies> , non-profit organizations and enterprises hoping to enter new markets .
Given Hong Kong's record volume of transactions and the surge in demand for <hong_kong> dollar , one might wonder whether Hong Kong's 32-year-old dollar-focused policy is appropriate and sustainable . Last week , the <hong_kong_monetary_authority> intervened in the market to address the linked <exchange_rate> system , for the first time since August . On Wednesday , Norman Chan , president of the <hong_kong_monetary_authority> , said last week's <stock_market_bubble> caused $4 .4 billion in inflows , compared to a total of $1 .3 billion spent by the <hong_kong_monetary_authority> in its intervention in the market last August .

Another explanation for the number of men who disbelieve more than women is "self-disclosure bias ," where respondents (even in anonymous surveys) try to give the "right" answers , even if the facts are not true . Either everyone may be lying , and some people are lying a lot .A British scholar found that the ratio of men to women becomes essentially flat if men claim to have 20 or more sexual partners .
Online dating can be awkward . You have to post a description and a photo online , not to say to millions , but to thousands of people , and you have to add in detail what kind of person you are looking for , and then wait for someone to express their interest in you .

Governments and markets should try to solve the temptations . We hope that lending institutions will require households to have certain savings to qualify for home purchases . Careful lending institutions could also propose that debt refinancing reduces the repayment period , thereby moving people away from the cycle of refinancing .

A decade ago , Apple launched the iPod , with the slogan "Put a thousand songs in your pocket ," a propaganda phrase that sums up the perfect fusion of content and carriers . The importance of the iPod is not only its birth but also its prophecy for the future . The era of <personal_computers> has come to an end since then , and a new era is being replaced . In this new era , a single handheld device can be used to access all the services provided by electronic means .
"I never knew I could ride 100 kilometers ," said Rose Tsou , Taiwan president of Yahoo , one of the women cyclists . "Now I know , and I love riding .

Several of the world's largest gold miners may have to tell investors that their growth has entered the <bottom_line> , as plummeting <gold_prices> have rendered some previously stored gold mines no longer worthy of exploitation .
There's something special about <hong_kong> : It's the only place in the world where I can't see the menu , so it's the place where I can't order anything . I've tried it many times and it's the same .
As the world's largest <mining_company> , B&B reported yesterday that its pre-tax earnings rose 22 per cent from $292 billion to $235 billion in the previous fiscal year as of June 30 , largely owing to the company's record production of several key commodities , China's "strong demand" for mineral products , cost reduction measures and its focus on high-margin growth projects , the company's seventh consecutive record profit .
But if there is any real component in this argument , it seems to be a first-world problem . In the <emerging_world> , the millennials have had a good time , and the ones in the shadow seem to be the opposite of their parents .
If there is no big change , the prospects for TD-SCDMA as a competing technology for 3G <mobile_phones> are uncertain , but it may still have a market for data cards that connect laptops to the Internet .

She says our goal is to become a "key figure" and that means creating a unique , lasting and profound impression . Action is the most important thing . It's a "show without saying" question and to "show" in an interesting way ," as Simon Cowell said to the rejected players on American Idol or The XFactor , "You just can't be remembered ."
Last but not least , it suggests that foreign influences may influence the policies of the parties that ultimately win the <presidential_election> without voters knowing . Last year , during the Republican Congress in Cleveland , Trump’s aides pushed to remove from the Republican agenda the wording that supports armed Ukraine’s fight against Russian-backed separatists . Whether this is a reasonable policy , it will certainly make former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and his pro-Russian Party of Regions (PartyofRegions) happy , allegedly clients of Manafort .
So far , the West has been forcing Putin to surrender by means of sanctions and diplomacy , which have certainly hurt the <russian_government> and deepened Russia's <economic_crisis> , but which have not prevented him from testing the Ukrainian government's defence capabilities and Western determination .
It has changed the world . It has changed the world's perception of China . For Beijing , this is an uncomfortable period . Until now , China has been rising in an arbitrary way . Sino-US relations have suffered all sorts of setbacks and storms , and sometimes stalemate , but in most cases , <western_countries> have either diverted attention or obeyed China . <Chinese leaders> have become accustomed to their own paths .

I think it's a good business for Americans , and certainly a well thought-out strategy that will help boost their <slowing_economy> . A large influx of reporters , lawyers and other stakeholders from Houston and Chicago are sure to inject large sums of money into the hotel industry and create substantial revenues for <mobile_phone> companies . Houston's revenues are particularly plentiful -- the region's latest news says that in another case involving price manipulation , the <united_states> sentenced three British defendants and then repatriated them to Britain , effectively handing over the first successful cartel case to the Office of Fair Trade .
With regard to <information_technology> , I believe that mass propaganda was perfectly reasonable at the time-it was just too early . The Internet had a revolutionary effect on the media , retail , banking , and our entire lives . Just like the two inventions of cars and trains , modern communications had a huge impact on our mobility . The reason why <information_technology> did not have a greater impact on productivity may be related to the way we measure productivity , not to <information_technology> itself .
The lower price seems to indicate , however , that the chances of a successful acquisition are slim . Alibaba offered a price of HK$6 .50 per share , with the higher price of HK$8 .60 on Friday being offset by a margin of 24 per cent , which led to a 13 .6 per cent drop in its shares on Monday and a 4 .1 per cent drop to HK$8 .25 on Friday .
The <us_senate> will vote on a historic nuclear <trade_agreement> between the <bush_administration> and India , under which nuclear trade between the US and India will be legalized , and the US Senate's vote is a key step towards ending India's 30-year blockade of nuclear technology . In such a situation , any Chinese assistance to Pakistan could serve as an excuse for Congress's pro-nuclear non-proliferation hawks .

Mr . Liang and his <hong_kong> colleagues hardly believed their ears . "What ? How could 300 ,000 people go to Shenzhen ," they asked , but they didn't think that 25 years later , Shenzhen would be a city with 10 million people .
After all , if Paulson did not include provisions allowing him to change his mind in the bailout plan , he might have to take a pragmatic approach . It would have been hard for Paulson to get Congress to approve his bailout plan without mentioning the prospect of any statehood , which would have only angered Republicans in Congress .
Supporters say the risk-based capital agreement requires many banks to avoid a worse fate in a <financial_crisis> .They argue that the alternative US approach to limiting banks' asset <balance sheet> leverage &mdash&mdash or related liability levels &mdash&mdash is ineffective , as banks simply transfer risk investments out of their asset <balance sheet>.
At the heart of the impasse is the dispute over Beijing's plans for Hong Kong's future 'political system .' Hong Kong's sovereignty was transferred from Britain to China in 1997 .

The recall of the world's largest toy company has exacerbated tensions in <trade_relations> between China and the <united_states> and damaged China's reputation . 80% of the world's toys are manufactured in China , but there are signs that governments and the toy industry are responding to the pressure .
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons says the number of arm surgeries has increased 40 times in the past 12 years , and it is clear that Michelle Obama has an enthusiastic pair of tight arms .While it is hard for the public to know whether the Chinese <first_lady> has undergone surgery , bloggers have praised her full-bodied hearing loss , as hearing loss is clearly a guarantee of a lifetime of well-being .(Her nose and chin look like Wangf , her mouth and teeth show that she is not a cheerful person , and her goose-eyed face is also a blessing .)

In May , Han's shares in a Hong Kong-listed company collapsed dramatically within half an hour and were subsequently suspended .Despite the fact that Han's founder , Lee Kuan , used Han's shares , a hydropower plant and other assets in China as collateral to apply for loans , no Chinese <financial_institution> has so far publicly confirmed that it has loans to either Han or Lee Kuan .
More convincing explanations are buyers' fatigue .According to Dealogic , $220 billion in IPO financing has been made by Chinese firms so far this year , four times the total of US and European IPO financing .In September , the average first-day raise was 42%, just over one-third as much as in July , while the number of new openings for Chinese investors' A-share trading accounts has been declining for the past six weeks , now less than half of the peak in late July .Foreign investors have also begun to withdraw .According to China's <equity_fund> , which is tracked by the <emerging_markets> <investment_fund> <research_company> (EPFR), investors redeemed $47 billion last week , transferring investments in <asian_stock_markets> to India and <south_korea> .

No . China's <national_security> Act , which will be enacted in 2020 , has changed the estimates of potential protesters .

Welcome to the latest subtle twist in modern American family structure – or at least in some more affluent and anxious families .Remember , after the end of World War II , when the baby boomer generation was born today , when charities and hospitals opened up formal courses to teach new-born mothers how to raise children .But nobody thought about what to teach grandparents to do : people thought they knew how to do it because they already had their own children .However , it was a normal phenomenon in the 1950s for mothers to bring children home , and as long as anyone taught other people how to raise children , grandmothers (not mothers) must be regarded as more qualified .

Through this platform , Professor Wright gave a calm and thoughtful comment on the current situation . His theme (in fact , the theme of the three-day celebration) is "leadership ." A horizontal panel hanging on one of the school's buildings asks the question "Who will lead ?"

I hope he can express his thanks for his support in the awards speech , because he is mainly looking after the children at home . Should I not risk taking him with me ?

As we know , the existing mechanisms in the eurozone do not meet the above conditions , and it is only today that temporary emergency measures have been put in place .

For example , to get the know-how to sell insurance or <credit_card> products , it just has to sell a few shares to Allianz or <american_express> , as Labour did four years ago .

"Second Life" is a virtual world where users can creatively design their own virtual image and use this virtual character to go to the site .
This week , China's <president_hu_jintao> rarely paid a <state_visit> to the <united_states> . Many Chinese viewed the passage of the <financial_crisis> as proof of the rationality of China's system and the beginning of an era when American liberalism no longer dominated . State-owned enterprises rejuvenated , and the <chinese_government> chose to implement a massive <economic_stimulus> program through state-owned enterprises .

It's understandable that they're looking for some broader sex appeal to people in Keynes's General Theory , not for technical analysis . I've tried to do so myself , too , by starting to quote Keynes's pro-expenditure statements in some of his articles , which originally came from some of his unofficial talks and articles in the 1930s , and which later became the material for the book . But it's quite wrong to start thinking primarily about "animal spirits ," especially in the current phase of the <business_cycle> .

There were obvious similarities between the two bankruptcies : first , the company's <chief_executives> claimed they were unaware of the specific operations , and , second , the use of some ugly off-the-shelf transactions designed to hide the facts . In Lehman's last three quarters , the resulting &ldquo buybacks of 105/108 &ldquo (Repo 105/108) increased by nearly a third to a total of $500 billion , thereby manipulating the bank's <balance_sheet> and reducing its reporting leverage .

Why does Merkel fail to honour her commitment to rescue the euro “as much as possible”?

When Mr . Tsang's new term ends five years later , imagine how much credit he would win if he could add to the existing rule of law and freedom of the press two new qualities of democracy and a cleaner environment to <hong_kong> .

Critics of laxism oppose the idea that prices should be allowed to decline until the bottom of the market is clear . They are wrong .

It is not easy to determine when an <asset_class> is at risk of bubbles , but hindsight can make it easy to identify the bubbles that have occurred over the past decade – securities , housing , credit and other <risky_assets> . The Fed has wrongly denied these bubbles , imagining that it would be able to deal with them afterwards .

It is often criticized that the commissions paid by the <fund_managers> are too high , too untransparent . The incentive mechanisms in the fund managers' pay agreements may indeed focus on short-term performance . But the 1 :1 ratio ceiling proposed by MEPs does not solve the problem . This would only lead the <fund_industry> to increase the proportion of fixed remuneration in order to circumvent this provision , as has already happened in the <banking_industry> .

Legislators should ensure that bonuses are issued on a transparent basis rather than limiting the amount of bonuses .

Once these materials have been submitted , however , the Fed should have the right to meet with non-executive directors to hear their reasons and background on risk assessments . The Fed may , as appropriate , share copies with appropriate regulators and management to facilitate full-time investigations . The Fed should have the right to publish copies of these "trustee risk assessments" to clarify investors' understanding of the board's risks . This review right will force management and board to respond positively to risks as a core strategy and operational challenge . The future trustee should not only oversee risks , but must also actively help define risks . Traditional "risk management" practices are not in line with the situation . There is a need for a more diversified approach .
As China gradually integrates into the <world_economy> , the unimaginable phenomenon of Chinese nationals (such as Ericlin) joining <foreign_companies> has become a reality .

But in countries where the number of young people exceeds the number of old people , the young people can hope for a better fate through the ballot box .

In both cases , the powerful forces that undermine stability are playing a role , bringing opportunities for some and disappointment for others .

But it is now being attacked , as psychologists Gerd Gigerenzer and economist Nathan Berg point out , that behavioral economics is not as realistic as its advocates claim it is . It does study what decisions we make , but it doesn't study how we make decisions at all – and , therefore , it is even more obsessed than neoclassical economics with stupid descriptions of how humans think .

When someone comes to you because they are worried about their health , it is usually useful if you can guess what they want you to do . They often want you to have them do one or even several tests . In terms of "checks ," people rarely refer to simple clinical tests : blood sugar levels , oxygen saturation and urine test paper .

Apart from CT scans , there are no tests that are more popular than taking an X-ray . You can almost imagine people thinking , "At last – there's an answer ! There's a result !" Undoubtedly , the potential effects of medical checks cannot be underestimated .

Last summer , the company sought to be listed in <new_york> under the name Silicon Technology Holdings . <market_turmoil> made it hope to become a bubble , and what investors are seeing now is a typical affiliate deal .

The new currency does not guarantee stability . What it means is that it increases the importance of fixing other policies . A euro-era country can only expand its "money supply" by increasing exports or <capital_inflows> .

This requires most "Eastern" countries (maybe excluding the Baltic states) to demonstrate their lack of flexibility .

The reason for choosing to sell <hong_kong> lights at this time may be simple : perhaps because Li Jian has targeted a low-price buyer , or because the <international_business> of the power industry now exceeds its domestic business . It may also be due to regulatory considerations : the public's direct ownership of <hong_kong> lights (not through the power industry) puts Li Jian under greater <political_pressure> as the rebate approaches , making it difficult to reduce the current 9 .9% regulatory return on <hong_kong> lights .

For China , the most powerful reason for allowing the renminbi to rise is that it is in its own economic interests . Market intervention required to keep the renminbi at a low level increases domestic liquidity , amplifies the asset-price bubble , and greatly increases the complexity of economic governance . Intervention also leads to lower yields for foreign-exchange reserves (mainly in dollars), which could have been better used at home and profited more .

A new wave of cutting-edge e-commerce applications is appearing on Facebook , signaling that the world's largest <social_networking_site> could quickly become a major destination for <online_shopping> .
The problem is that the <political_system> of globalization is lagging behind the <economic_system> more than ever before . Although the West has acknowledged that power is flowing to the East , it still wants to think about things as it did in the past . In this world of "them" and "we ," the Democratic candidates in the US <presidential_campaign> condemned "they" for stealing "our" jobs . Today , you hear Europeans say that by burning "our" fuel , eating "our" food , "they" are constantly pushing up international <commodity_prices> .

The recent announcement by Joseph Tsai , executive vice president of Alibaba , a group of Chinese retailers , that a family office would be set up to invest his $60 billion in wealth has inevitably given rise to a sense of momentum .

Over the past two years , Blair has not been optimistic about the prospects for signing a follow-up agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , admitting that the <united_states> is strongly opposed to any attempt to set carbon targets .
The potential agreement is one of the core elements of the EU’s broader “three-pronged” strategy for China , which identifies China as “economic competitor” and “systemic competitor” and as a partner in certain areas .
On the one hand , the founding of Japan's first racing academy fits well with the (although somewhat bizarre) thrilling development of professional racing and the increasingly lucrative gaming market that has driven the rise of racing .After decades of economic and technological waves (which have had a powerful push on social media), online games such as LeagueofLegends and Dota2 have become a globally popular sport with an estimated audience of over 400 million people and a total revenue of about $650 billion .

Anders Behring Breivik seems to have confessed to these crimes , and there is no doubt that he will try to use the July 25 hearing to promote himself .
Perhaps the places we love are either stuck in time for some reason , or not in time , and so nothing seems to have changed : as a result of winter storms , some stretches of California's Greater Surge coastline are regularly blocked for months (massive rocks block unstable single-lane roads), so that the population seems to be shrinking – if anything , it seems as if the whole region is becoming more and more backward , returning more and more to rocks and oceans .

His 23-year-old son , Alexander , sits on the armchair and shakes his father's hair to say goodbye . Others see it as a signal to leave the seat . That night , Soros was a little bit nervous and cheerful - he had reason to be happy , because he had long believed Obama would win . Michael Vachon , his political adviser , kept in his document a wrinkled schedule of his February 2004 trip to Chicago , in the upper right-hand corner of which Vachon scribbled "Baraccos ."

Universities have certainly grown . Today , the proportion of young people under the age of 30 receiving <higher_education> is as high as 50%. At every stage of this long-term trend , there are skeptics who say that the demand cannot continue , but it does . <south_korea> – one of the "heroes" in the fight against the new pandemic , which has adopted sophisticated and effective anti-epidemic measures – has 70 per cent of young people enrolled in universities . 18 years ago , the birth rate in the UK was at historically low levels , so the real challenge now is to plan for further growth as the number of young people starts to grow again .
Fitzgerald's most ingenious trick was the way he handled fashion products . In the magazine's front page , he abandoned the masculine form and turned to the figures of bright tennis stars like Federer and adventurers like Bear Grylls , who dress in fashion but are easy to relate . By presenting the interesting and versatile experiences of these men , the magazine quietly conveys the elements of fashion to the desire to know their male readers , a Trojan horse-style strategy .

Mr Yamamoto believes that the dominance of large companies in the <business_world> is weakening , partly due to the entrepreneurship education that "young people don't want to be a junior graduate in a big company ," which has boosted the enthusiasm of academics to commercialize their research results .At the same time , after the creation of a new department to deal with <intellectual_property> cases in Japan , academics are likely to be more proactive in protecting their own <intellectual_property> .

I agree with your reluctance to buy insurance , but I disagree with your reasoning . There is no inherently unreasonable thing about <life_insurance> (although it is not an attractive product for people without <family_members> or selfish tendencies). Overall , however , <life_insurance> is one of the few types of insurance to be purchased reasonably because it prevents the risk of major losses . Another type of insurance is sickness insurance – travel insurance also has this function ; but you may not have to worry about it , as EU citizens can enjoy cheap health care within the <member_states> .
Subsidiary Bank said its request for <financial_support> exceeded its initial $50 billion allocation for pandemic-related projects .
Among the ten principles of war taught to all students at the United Kingdom's Sandhurst Military College , the most important one is dealing with "surprises ." During his tenure as commander of the US and NATO forces in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal needed to deal with a number of possible career-threatening emergencies , including suicide bombers , unreliable Afghan political partners , and so on . But we have reason to believe that he would never think of his dismissal for an article in Rolling Stone , one of the most important cultural magazines in the <united_states> .
White also warned yesterday at the SWIFT International <banking_operations> Symposium (Sibos), which opened in <hong_kong> , that the government's short-term measures to help the economy recover may be laying the seeds for a future crisis .

As far as I know , this is a relatively new phenomenon . In the past , from <margaret_thatcher> to Nancy Reagan , there has been no famous powerful woman without a bag .

More remarkable is the Chinese government’s reluctance to use <monetary_policy> instruments . Although markets are generally expecting the <central_bank> to <raise_interest_rates> too late , the rate is unlikely to be high enough to bring China back to a moderate level . The result is that <monetary_policy> will remain excessively expansive .
As <warren_buffett> put it : “Only when the tide is receding do you know who is swimming naked .” For <emerging_economies> , the financial tide is receding under the influence of the strong dollar (driven by a dangerous combination of <us_fiscal> austerity and tighter monetary policy). So who is swimming naked ? Argentina , which is still struggling to recover from 12 years of left-wing populist rule by the Kirchners , is a typical example today . Is Argentina the only one ? Well , perhaps not .
In 2015 , Blued received $30 million in the second round of large-scale financing , bringing its total valuation to $300 million .

This argument must be rejected . Both the <united_states> and China are engaged in cyberattacks , but their specific actions vary widely . The U .S . aim is primarily to obtain information that helps protect <national_security> . China's actions are said to be different . It is reported that China's cyberattacks (often conducted by the military) involve largely theft of <intellectual_property_rights> from <western_companies> . China has consistently denied such acts , but <western_companies> say they find the situation shocking .
But killing terrorists is not going to win the war on terror . Most of the Indian politicians and security experts I spoke to in September last year undoubtedly held this view . They were sceptical of US attacks in Pakistan and put forward common arguments that bombing suspicious terrorist bases would result in civilian casualties , and that this would only continue to send fresh blood to the jihadist cause . New Delhi recognized at the time that it was better for Pakistan to solve the problem .

The debate about austerity – and the relationship between public deficits , national debt , and growth – neglects a key issue : unless a country is on the verge of collapse , the size of its debt or deficit is not as important as what taxpayers are actually financing . If such spending supports areas that accelerate <economic_growth> by increasing productivity and innovation , such as education , skills , research , and new technologies , debt may account for a lower long-term ratio (and governments are expected to be in a better position) than inefficient spending .
At last week's performance conference , Emma Walmsley , <chief_executive> of GSK , a British pharmaceutical company , denied the possibility of a shortage of active drug ingredients , namely APIs , saying , "We are looking at this issue and we have no problem in the short term ," and that the company is "prepared for this kind of problem , but we need to look closely at how long this situation will last .

Brown’s strategy has always been confusing : in his ten years or more of collaboration with Blair , there have been frequent conflicts between the two sides , and almost always around the question of succession .

Free-market fundamentalists hope that the imminent wave of <government_intervention> will rapidly revert , allowing the markets to once again enjoy light regulation . It is a wishful thinking .

Whether the UK voted to leave the EU or <donald_trump> was elected president of the <united_states> could hardly be interpreted as making the world more predictable , but for the former , the <domestic_stock> market only shrugged (after initial nervousness and a massive adjustment of the pound), and for the latter , the <stock_market> reported a slight upturn . elsewhere , the failure of Matteo Renzi in the Italian constitutional referendum did not cause too much disruption to Italian <debt_markets> .
"Home debt is the biggest piece of additional lending in the <banking_system> ," Fitch said , predicting that by 2020 China's share of household debt and <disposable_income> could exceed 100 per cent , which would mean that formerly frugal Chinese would become almost as wasteful as Americans , with the U .S . accounting for 105 per cent .
But , like any maturing <business_cycle> , these issues may benefit the biggest manufacturers . China's largest manufacturers have already increased their share of the domestic wind power market , crowding out the shares of small and medium-sized enterprises and foreign competitors .

<us_president_barack_obama> has pledged to assess his government's policy in Afghanistan in December , after which the US should stop talking about exit strategies and accept that the Taliban will inevitably take control of much of southern Afghanistan's Pushtun territory . Thus , Washington should , over the next several years , use US <air_force> , special forces (40 ,000 to 50 ,000 troops), Afghan forces , and the help of allied countries to ensure that neither the north nor the west of Afghanistan falls like the south . Such a de facto partition is a deplorable end to the decades of US efforts in Afghanistan , but regrettably the best result that can now be achieved in a realistic and responsible manner .

The eurozone’s plan to “deduct” Greece’s debt is aimed at pursuing its daydream (no need at all) that no member state’s <sovereign_debt> can default . It is a foolish idea to believe that swaps of <bad_debt> can escape the downward spiral of ratings . But eurozone leaders have insisted on “voluntary” participation by bondholders in an effort to avoid a “credit event” – that is , a debt swap decided by the International Association for Exchange and Derivatives (ISDA) to repay the “Greek debt” CDS .

Goldberg has a dual Greek and American nationality and a profound academic background , including five years as the first female editor of the well-known journal American Economic Review , a position that is both smooth and firm when it comes to accepting or rejecting academic career posts .
In short , it is believed that Bear Stearns is of systemic importance and cannot be shut down . Yes , this view was formed hastily at the time of the crisis , but it was at the time of the emergence of new functions , particularly the role of the 19th-century <central_bank> as the “last lender .”

Much of the good news , however , comes from the extraordinary levels of liquidity chasing opportunities around the globe , largely as a result of the Fed’s expansionary <monetary_policy> and <us_government> <fiscal_stimulus> measures in the early part of the century . The yen has also made it easier to expand active investment and leverage acquisitions that are now ubiquitous . <low_interest_rates> , massive accumulated liquidity , the pursuit of profits and the lack of differentiation between borrowers have not only stimulated vigorous <economic_growth> , but have also raised some real concerns .
Since the ECB launched a three-year long-term refinancing operation last December , the price differences between Italian and Spanish banks in the “credit default swap” have declined , and the sovereign-debt gap between some weak countries and Germany has also shrunk .
Morgan Stanley last year negotiated an unspecified deal to sell its oil business to state-owned Russian <oil_company> Rosneft -- a deal that is clearly facing up to changes .

Months after the deal was signed , the Russian army entered Crimea , enabling the state-owned <oil_company> to gain a deeper understanding of the geopolitical challenges of the <us_market> .
The growing impact on Japanese life in Guangdong may surprise those who remember the April 2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations in China , when stone throwers attacked Japanese factories , consulates , and restaurants in China's cities , sparking debate that Japanese investors might quickly turn to other low-cost production centers such as Vietnam .

It is easy to dismiss the current inflation surge as a temporary phenomenon . After all , once the weather improves and farmers are clear about time , <food_prices> tend to stabilize rapidly , and <energy_prices> may start to fall as the Middle East recovers .

Despite the positive action taken by governments around the world , <stock_markets> have fallen . These government measures do not seem to have had a positive impact on <investor_confidence> and have caused investors to turn to safe assets such as <government_bonds> . Last weekend , <european_leaders> issued a crown-of-the-century statement pledging to act together and then to act separately , which investors did not feel comfortable with , and European stocks have been hit hard . In Europe , the German governments announced guarantees for personal savings at the weekend , followed by similar measures by governments in Denmark , Sweden and Austria .
The downturn also included interest-rate-sensitive industries , such as <real_estate> and utilities , which fell due to the rise in indicators for measuring "inflation expectations ."According to US inflation-guaranteed Treasury prices , the 10-year balance-of-payments rate broke 2% Monday , for the first time since late 2018 .

A Romance with an Economic Sustainability Researcher came to an abrupt end . For this romantic experience , I gave up the opportunity to spend Christmas with my family , paying the emotional and financial cost of a transatlantic trip and spending 11 of my 20 days on vacation . Given that he had proposed that "we could spend Christmas with your family next year ," or that it was uncertain whether it would come next year , should I get some compensation ?
I almost wanted to kiss her . Not only because she dared to use such a straightforward word (which contrasts sharply with the empty phrase that nobody cares about when it comes to the diversity of the board), but also because her point of view caught my ear as fresh as a spring breeze , even though I still implicitly felt that she might not be entirely right . I countered , the ideal number of crazy people on the board is clearly zero

Obviously , the real enrichment key is to attract the interest of a TV news crew : that means about three people each need a 15-pound cup of coffee from the Yemeni plains . Obviously , you'll then buy a few more cups to taste for the locals to produce a prime-time evening news broadcast at 10 :20 p .m . Of course , this priceless coffee is just for the sake of stirring up and attracting the enthusiastic fans . Old customers can buy a regular cup of coffee for just £3 .50 .
But another game , the staghunt , is relatively unknown . In this game , two hunters must decide for themselves whether to hunt a common deer or a rabbit alone .

Hunt Brothers hoarded white silver for some time to manipulate the market in the 1970s , and <warren_buffett> made big purchases in the late 1990s , partly reflecting the rise in <gold_prices> and doubts about the legal value of central bank-controlled currencies .

Treasury and the Chairman of the <federal_reserve> are not consistent with their actual actions , resulting in a weak dollar .
The "software" of China's political economy will still be based on centralized control . But the rapid growth of China has obscured and weakened this control , owing to the expansion of <local_governments> and the rise of private <economic_power> networks . China's "software" has also been severely downgraded due to "deficiencies" such as rampant corruption and severe misalignment of resource allocation . Under the control and will of the <chinese_government> , this growing functional flaw has become a source of disappointment .
Yesterday's announcement of the listing plan signaled a sharp reversal of the company's statement last week that it would "consider listing in both locations at the appropriate time at the end of the transaction".
Dual-capture systems can bring advantages to smartphones that previously belonged to independent cameras . They can speed up autofocusing and improve low-light imaging . One of these cameras can be multi-fold-focused without affecting screen quality or larger volume . Additional cameras can also provide wider angles to provide better scenery shooting and selfie effects . Combined with appropriate image processing software , they can add costly single-capture effects (such as background faintness or shallow view depth) without the need to install additional lenses .
Last June , when several <world leaders> gathered in Rio for the largest environmental summit in two decades , observers faced two dilemmas : Should they wait in the conference rooms to watch the presidents and <prime_ministers> perform , or should they watch the various green business activities that Microsoft and many other companies are organising in the city ?

I think China is very similar to the <united_states> after the Second World War – a huge single-language market in which <consumer_demand> is growing and which will bring other regions of Asia and many <emerging_markets> into its growth trajectory .
However , before we get lost in the details , we should consider in general . This law answers many questions . For anyone who wants to compete fairly in China , most of the answers should be welcome news .
Officials in the executive branch of the Securities and <exchange_commission> (SEC) are seeking talks with several banks with a view to finding a solution to restore market liquidity , several people familiar with the matter said .
But if these backward views are as he says they cannot be eradicated , how can they explain India's growth since its opening up in the early 1990s ?

Morgan Stanley <chief_financial_officer> Colm Keller denies that mandatory convertible equity units issued to <chinese_investment> firms are a costly form of financing .

Bank of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) plus a 5 <percentage_point> surcharge on their after-tax interest .

In spite of all its flaws , an economy that follows the prophecy that greed is a good thing has a higher standard of living than an economy that follows a far-left ideology . "Greed is a good thing" is Gordon Gekko's proverb , borrowed from Ivan Boesky : "Greed is healthy ."
Despite the difficulties faced , the policies pursued from top to bottom (because of the lack of powerful trade unions) are a step in the right direction .While blaming China for saving too much is "ridiculous ," he understands that China's 1 .3 billion people must reduce their savings and increase their consumption .Already in 2006 , he warned of China's "unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated and unsustainable" economy .He did not say that the situation facing China is the same as the situation facing the rest of the world , given China's rising share of the <global_economy> .

Don't worry , Brexiteers : I don't want to reignite the debate on the 2016 Brexit referendum . Rather , I want to discuss what has changed in our relationship with language since then . Today , with the acceleration of technological progress , the times are changing faster and faster . In just two years , the lesson most people have learned is that they don't believe what anyone but their private circle of friends says (which is <bad_news> for those of us who are writing for a living).If Brexiteers now make commitments about NHS , few believe it .But once everyone becomes suspicious of everything , how do they get to know the world
The K .R . <hong_kong> office is located on the 56th floor of one of Hong Kong's highest rented office buildings .

Lunch dishes had been arranged , not in plastic boxes as I thought , but in beautiful Wedgwood porcelain dishes . A hemp napkin had been arranged , embroidered with K .R .

The political impact of the Ukrainian revolution is far beyond its own borders . For 25 years , the country , which has a dangerous patchwork of land and territory between the EU and Russia , has been the target of Russia’s geopolitical rivalry with the West . In 2008 , <us_president> George W . Bush made a poor attempt to get the West to win the race decisively by trying to bring the two former Soviet states , Ukraine and Georgia , into the US-led NATO . Russia responded by force by firmly cracking down on any new attempts to weaken Russia’s influence on neighbouring countries , blocking the two countries’ bids to join NATO , and invading Georgia . But today’s revolution in Kiev’s Independence Square provides a second opportunity for all parties to rethink the identity of Ukraine on the European fault line .

I didn't go to architecture school in Germany . I just wanted to go out , so I went to the U .S . and traveled around . <new_york> is a place I like . I like anonymity and intimacy . The reason for intimacy is because it's a city of all kinds of foreigners and people really take care of each other . For friends who don't have a place to go to the night before Christmas , they take more care of each other , they reach out for help , it's great . Everybody feels that way . Once you live in <new_york> , you feel a sense of belonging , you kind of have <new_york> .

Earlier reports indicated that the buyer of the British oil stake was a subsidiary of the <central_bank> of China's State Foreign Exchange Authority (SAFE), rather than a newly formed <china_investment_corp> . The foreign office , which controls China's <foreign_exchange_reserves> , has adopted a more aggressive investment style in recent months , recently acquiring a 1 .6% stake in Total , the world's fourth-largest <oil_group> . Economic patriots fear the foreign office far more than the company . China's foreign office is larger and growing faster : as economist Brad Setter points out , China's increased <foreign_exchange_reserves> are estimated to reach $60 billion this year , and are approaching the size of the portfolio managed by the world's largest sovereign fund <abu_dhabi> Investment Authority .

One of the terrible conditions of extreme mental distress , as Borgia so brilliantly put it , is that language becomes dull and meaningless . It is a little unrealistic to want to have a conversation with someone who is extremely emotionally depressed . But it is not impossible to get along with that person . Just as it is when faced with death , perhaps only a body language has meaning , just like the hand you held when he was there . A good lunch will make us realize how lucky we are : if we reflect and translate the words of our heart into language , that language will still bring rich meaning and joy . Even if we do not have the traditional piousness of Christianity , but when we share bread together , we should pray for thanksgiving .
The moderate degree of <global_economic_slowdown> affecting China remains to be seen . Exports will obviously be affected , but , in contrast , optimists argue that there is room for growth in investment as the impacted "Western enterprises" seek to "cut costs" by further outsourcing to cheaper markets . Perhaps more optimistic is the view that China's "domestic demand" will take over the relay rod , thereby providing China with its difficult but urgently needed economic adjustment . Before China becomes a large consumer country , it must undertake larger <structural_reforms> , particularly the construction of a similar welfare system .
China's Ministry of Commerce responded yesterday in a modest manner to a request by the EU and the <united_states> to consult the WTO on the Chinese government's financial news and information provisions .

The Chinese factor has become a central issue in the News Group's bid for the <dow_jones> deal , as Merkel's experience in China has been controversial and many <analysts_believe> that China's rise will be one of the most important business milestones in many years to come .

This is not to say that we should insist that all girls pursue careers in engineering , <computer_science> , or astrophysics . Of course , we shouldn't demand that of every boy . This intense focus would create another imbalance . I want to see gender equality in all areas . We have a responsibility to provide children with as many career choices as possible so that they can make wise choices . We should encourage them to take advantage of their own strengths .

In short , Britain’s inequality is more closely linked to the high drop-out rate in the Chinese <higher_education> system than to the country’s private railway system , free labour laws , or social mobility levels . If this analysis is correct , it means that the task facing the <british_government> is like going backwards and trying to reduce inequality through taxation and welfare policies . It also means that countries with higher drop-out rates are more likely to experience an increase in <income_inequality> caused by globalization and <technological_change> .

I'm currently experiencing a phase of chocolate crocodile skin . At least I hope it's just a phase . A dark-brown crocodile skin handbag in Prada's advertisement , which calls me a few times a day , in which a woman leans inside the car and doesn't need anything else to be around . This amazes me . Usually I don't like things that clearly show who I am . I know they have the power to age you , to push you forward for the next 10 years , just like a rich makeup agent can do . Having a persistent treasure secret and producing something exquisite doesn't usually attract me . I like shopping , and things that are permanently persistent and make it hard to buy new things for sufficient reasons . I'll have this handbag in my next half-life ? No way !

Part of the problem is that the group relies on imported oil to extract fuel to meet the needs of India's 100 million cars and three-wheelers (and other so-called complex products), while the most important JANUARY refinery (which has a pipeline that connects Seattle and Miami) is suitable for refining heavy <crude_oil> . This was a good idea in the golden age after 2004 , when there were few refineries capable of refining heavy <crude_oil> , so the price of such <crude_oil> was cheap . But now that refineries have entered the sector , demand has naturally pushed up prices . The group's fourth-quarter profit rate has fallen by nearly one-fifth of a year .

Noam Chomsky , one of the most important linguists of the twentieth century , was confronted with a difficulty in producing a grammatical but meaningless sentence . He came up with the following sentence : "A boring childish thought went madly asleep ." China held a central economic working meeting last weekend to discuss the plan for next year and produced similarly meaningless sentences .

In the long run , it is some eternal and universal truth that determines the country's success or failure . In short , the empire will rise when it is productive , fiscally sound , income more than expenditure , asset growth more than debt . This tends to happen in times when its people are educated , work hard , and behave civilized . As I have recorded in a study under way , in the objective comparison of China and the <united_states> based on these criteria , we find that the fundamentals are clearly beneficial to China .
In terms of scale and structure , the programmes announced by countries are what is needed . It is difficult to contain the distortionary effects of guarantees and how to get out of some of the nationalized systems into a new system that is more regulated than before , but statements this week (especially in the storm-hit United States) should diminish such concerns .*

A few years ago , in a short film directed by the Monster Pythons , four Yorkshire men fought each other to cover up their childhood hardships , and the four people's lies are unbelievable . The modern version of the short film is likely to turn into :

Since the outbreak of the <financial_crisis> , the <united_states> has been unable to make structural adjustments , which has made the economic wounds worse .

One might imagine a country that is weaker in financial strength and competitiveness to leave the <euro_area> , such as Greece , where I think there is a probability of about 20 to 25 per cent . Most of the agreements , including <bank_deposits> , <sovereign_debt> , pensions and wages , will be re-priced in the new Dracma (the currency Greece did not have before joining the euro area), and the new currency will subsequently depreciate dramatically (a depreciation of 65 per cent , for example).

I looked in the direction of his fingers , but there was nothing to see . After he had thrown several stones in front , he saw only 20 meters away that one animal fled quickly : this was a wild cat , a rare , flat-faced wild cat , tall and beautiful , named Palas'scat . The wild cats were terrified , but the stone was not much of a threat to them . Then two huge dark shadows appeared in the midst of the air , and they fled along the snow -- two golden statues with wings extending two meters (or even longer) long , and they were accompanied by silence , almost like a wild cat who had been stuck on the ground and had been scattered along the Z-shaped route .

Perhaps it is better than The Forsyte Saga : it paints a historical picture of the Dadaist evolutionary race , the father's hand to his son , a terrifying preparation for life's naked desires and fears . The great film Hukkle , directed by Balfour , is a black-humoured piece of countryside that observes human behavior and crime in almost abstract ways , as seen from the footprints left in the natural scenery . The new film will unwittingly shock rough-hearted spectators , scare bold spectators , and get disgusting attention from good-looking people . But it is a signature , a wisdom , and a terrible force .

Despite a moderate slowdown in growth in the US , the rest of the world will continue to grow rapidly – a hypothesis that seems reasonable .

The ultimatum game is the simplest form of a game in which one participant (Abby) receives a envelope containing 100 one-dollar bills . She can decide how much to give to the second participant (Zack). Zack either accepts the ultimatum or both of them get nothing . If Zack's motivation is only to get cash , he should agree even if only one dollar . But in reality , people have other considerations . If the game takes place in a laboratory , the first participant will usually distribute it more equally , and if she distributes it too generously to the second participant , she may regret it .

The problem is that , as a British airport operator , BAA's management is not only unsatisfactory under normal circumstances , but it has also performed poorly in recent crises . Flights have been cancelled or delayed mainly because the BAA lacks sufficient skilled personnel to perform security checks . If an X-ray scan of a handbag takes three minutes , it is either an hour before the flight starts or has already been delayed for three hours , and the inspection takes three minutes . The only reason for the delay is that the BAA has decided that it would rather wait for passengers than spend extra money hiring staff to improve security checks . Waiting for passengers , or spending more money to improve security checks , are two motivations that cannot coexist , and because the airport is a monopoly business , there is no competition forcing it to change .

Although the final net bill will be less than €10 billion in advance payment arrangements , a more stringent approach to the UK’s payment obligations will significantly increase the €6 billion payment estimate mentioned by <european_commission> Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker , reflecting the harder positions of many <eu_member_states> , which have abandoned reservations about the political risks involved in the UK’s withdrawal bills , and are calling on Mr Barroso to help fill gaps in the EU’s common budget related to the UK’s withdrawal .

If the evidence proves that the British <intelligence_services> were complicit in torturing and tormenting terrorist suspects in Libya , the archives that emerged after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi are vital both for the British people and for the British <intelligence_services> themselves to ascertain what happened , what did not happen , and to exercise full political accountability .
The term “lame duck” is too mild to adequately reflect the situation that <donald_trump> will face . At home , Democrats want to turn his remaining presidency into an “oil duck .” This is not a good sign for America’s allies . Presidents tied to their legs often turn to the global stage for performance . <richard_nixon> has made some of the most important <foreign_policy> moves during the Watergate crisis .

Last October , BMW announced it would acquire a <majority_stake> in a <joint_venture> with China's domestic car maker , Brilliant Automotive , for €3 .6 billion . The news did not cause a stir , as it is one of China's weaker <car_companies> and has limited funds available to invest in new plants .

However , Theresa May's government has bluntly suggested the need for a new <industrial_policy> .

The decision to sell ARM raises a question : Overall , is the board of directors still focusing too much on the quick returns of shareholders rather than on the long-term development of Britain's leading world-class firms ?

Whatever system you look at , the history of the twentieth century was a process of co-development between markets and states . To some extent , it was a superpower , because it was no longer the governments of each country that decided everything .

Merchants say they are working to prepare companies for more difficult regulatory and approval processes . <us_policymakers> have recently given the government greater powers to review and reject even small sensitive technology investments for <national_security> reasons .

A year ago , the French economist Alain Allais proposed the Allais paradox . He found that most people have a very different attitude to very high probabilities than to things that are determined by outcomes . Normal people do not only think this , but they have reasons to do so . There is no 99 percent probability in the real world . Extremely high and extremely low probabilities are tricks of the model , and the model can perfectly describe the world's probabilities well below 1 percent . Once you combine the probabilities generated by the model computation with the (unknown but fairly high) probabilities of the model itself , the comfort you long for will not exist .

The most obvious threat is the crisis in the world's most important political and economic relationship , the US-China relationship . Despite its reputation as a warrior , the <bush_administration> has been trying to avoid confrontation with China ; the <chinese_government> has no intention of conflicting with the <united_states> either – at least not now . Globalization has created a network of common interests .

Not long ago , banks and politicians , whether in the <banking_industry> or in politics , were part of a sort of parochial interest in economics .

Anxious waiting has begun again – it has become commonplace . For days , markets have been paying close attention to the attitude of the Greek political establishment as to whether Greece will accept the terms of the second bailout package – further <austerity_measures> .

It is precisely because Russia has re-emerged in the hostility of the West that it will remain vigilant about the East in the coalition .

But , given the high employment rate , the US may also allow the <current_account_deficit> to account for 4% of GDP .

Huawei Technologies , one of China’s most successful companies , has become a model for the <chinese_government> to push domestic firms “to the global stage .”
Banks with higher <capital_adequacy> are actually weaker banks . Yes , adequate capital can help in sustained losses , but keeping high <capital_adequacy> will only make banks weaker , not stronger , unless losses occur . Reducing leverage means smaller potential assets , lower <net_profits> and equity returns , and lending is suppressed . Even healthy banks like <deutsche_bank> , whose loans totaled just over two years ago in the <first_quarter> of 2012 , similarly , JPMorgan's net commercial loans reported last week are similar to 2009 levels .
Gomes (Dasilvya) and Crandall Bowles , another associate <chief_executive> of SpringsGlobal and <chief_executive> of Spring Industries , are also considering a new divisional partnership in Europe to boost sales in Europe .

As of the second quarter of June , Germany’s <gross_domestic_product> (GDP) may have grown by as much as 1 .7 per cent , one of the best performances since German reunification in 1990 . But , as some fear , if the “American recovery” comes to a head , and the world plunges into a “double bottom” recession , Germany’s recovery , driven by exports of engineering technologies , may be in trouble .

The price hike ended the downturn since early September -- a 36 per cent drop in total -- due to fears of <slowing_economic_growth> . China's <steel_mills> have stopped buying <iron_ore> in the <current_market> , which accounts for 60 per cent of the international trading market for current-use <iron_ore> .
Officials say the rest of the <population_growth> is mainly due to rising births and declining deaths . But even in this respect , immigration has played a role in helping to raise the number of women of childbearing age . Last year , one quarter of newborns in England and Wales were born abroad .
Some of the top talents meet these criteria , including Arminio Fraga , an economist at Princeton who has held senior positions at Soros <fund_management> and Salomon Brothers and performed well at the Brazilian <central_bank> , and Kemal Dervis , director of the <united_nations_development_programme> , who taught at Princeton and became vice-president of the World Bank , proved his talents during the Turkish <financial_crisis> by acting as an efficient and popular <finance_minister> .
At the time of its introduction , under <chinese_president_xi_jinping> , China has tightened up its censorship system to a greater extent , while the growing <civil_society> is pushing for more social and judicial reforms .

According to Glenn Maguire , Asian economist at Societe Generale in France , Asian consumers are facing the fact that “food <price_rises> have moved from cyclical to structural-driven .”
The institutions responsible for supervising the <financial_markets> can be said to be masters of the elaboration of detailed rules manuals . For decades , they have viewed this as their main job , and for good reason : enterprises prefer clear rules ; legislators want to avoid handing over discretionary powers to non-elected regulators ; and the public naturally wants to know what standards enterprises are required to adhere to .
They have invested a lot of money in the British <national_health_service> and <education_system> , as if it were only money that could initiate and shape change . Like other policies , Blair's insight into this policy is correct , but its implementation is a mess . Blair believes that the design defects of welfare and the "public service" system reinforce social inequality and impede the progress and development of the weakest groups . This view is essentially correct . Indeed , the core of Blairism is to find a modern way of achieving the traditional social equity goals of the Social Democrats .
The Chinese couple , who owned two garages and a repair shop in Urumqi , lost their business in a week-long civil violence that swept the northwestern Xinjiang capital and shaken the local fragile stability .
Even if the US had an efficient government , it would be hard for them to come up with any remedies . Fiscal and <monetary_policy> are nearly exhausted , and the options available for more action are both limited and risky . But this idea of finding the best policy at this stage is an empty one , because the US has no efficient government at all .

Separating pure sovereign risks (reduced to those borne or indebted to the financial and non-financial private sectors) from risks generated solely in those sectors , my judgments on the solvency of different entities in the <euro_area> are as follows . For pure sovereign risks , I consider Greece to be unconditionally bankrupt ; for Italy and Portugal to be solvent , but conditional on a return to long-term growth . I consider Spain , Ireland and other sovereign governments to be fundamentally solvent , excluding , of course , banks . For another type of risk , I consider the <private_sector> and financial sectors of Spain , Portugal and Ireland to be bankrupt .
From a traditional <foreign_policy> point of view , cyberspace is a new game of the old game (countries competing for strategic advantages). During the 1940s , Russia and the <united_states> fought each other . We may now be at the beginning of the Second <cold_war> . Therefore , the Russian government's use of cyber espionage and the leakage of strategic information to disrupt US domestic politics are just another round of giant tricks . The Obama administration's response to the expulsion of Russian diplomats and the imposition of sanctions is just the way to govern the cyber era .
A year ago , the $1 .3 billion Sri Lankan port of Hambantota was unveiled in a euphoria . Today , the only ships here are a handful of abandoned tugboats and a half-sunk small boat . At the $2 .09 billion <international_airport> 20 km north , two women checked in 10 hours after the arrival of the second and last flight of the day . Nearby sits a 340 ,000-seat football stadium , which has hosted only one professional event in the past two years .

Why does Germany have such a large surplus ? The more superficial answer is that Germany no longer has its own currency and therefore cannot adjust its nominal <exchange_rate> . This answer denies the underlying reasons . During the <eurozone_crisis> , Germany insisted on fiscal austerity in the eurozone as a whole . In addition , Germany also laid down a balanced budget in its constitution . This prevented Germany from having deficits and thus from offsetting the surpluses generated by the <private_sector> . The root of Germany's structural surplus lies in the combination of two reasons : on the one hand , strict fiscal regulations ; and , on the other , the necessary measures to deal with the effects of ineffective crisis management in the eurozone have brought down the euro .
The bonds were issued to bail out Goldman Sachs at the height of the <financial_crisis> , giving Berkshire-Hassaway the right to buy a 9% stake in the company before October 1 , this year , at $115 per share , but in a post-amendment <deal_announced> yesterday , Goldman said it would give Berkshire shares equivalent to the book profits of the bonds .
"It proves that we are trusting each other with farmers in running such large commodities in such a short period of time ," CFA <chief_executive> Jiang Tao said to delegates at the <financial_times> Global commodity summit .
Brown once excitedly uploaded a video of himself sitting in an autopilot Tesla on YouTube , a technology he trusted and believed people would make mistakes . But Brown's mistakes were unusual : his behavior looked like a super smart car , but in fact the car wasn't that smart . The car does help drivers control direction and brake , but it can't drive completely independently .
So which side is right ? Each side is right , and neither is wrong . What we are hearing is the result of a mutually destructive clash of ever-smaller <global_demand> . The road ahead lies in competitive devaluation and <trade_wars> . The solution is to expand demand , but <surplus_countries> need to do more than <deficit_countries> .
Although the figure is slightly higher than January’s 0 .8%, the lowest <inflation_rate> in five years , it is far below the Chinese government’s “about 3%” <inflation_target> this year .

The rise in <private_equity_investors> is not likely to threaten <capital_markets> , as most of the companies they have acquired will eventually be re-listed .However , the rise in <private_equity_investors> is raising increasing concerns about the "privatization" of large US and <european_companies> , which would reduce corporate managers' accountability to the public and deprive small and medium-sized investors of the opportunity to buy their shares .
The characteristics of Nordic capitalism , she said , were openness to globalization , but balanced by strong government measures to protect people from excessive globalization , and an equal <education_system> .

At the time , it must have seemed like a good idea .Coca-Cola put out an advertisement showing a charismatic actress who said that sticking a soft drink with it would make people fat , rot their teeth , and contain too much caffeine , but the decision had the opposite effect .Yesterday , a consumer watchdog ruled that the advertisement was completely unacceptable .
The service is not only aimed at foreign newcomers with overweight luggage (they don't even know the rules in the UK , newcomers' luggage is usually simpler).UniBaggage says a small number of newcomers in the UK don't know the rules , and the number of newcomers is increasing .
"As for the reform of state-owned banks , the main issues are the establishment of <corporate_governance> , boards of directors , and connections with internal institutions , but the hardest part is the transformation of a state-owned bank into a <commercial_bank> ," said Guo Xue , chairman of <china_construction_bank> .
On the eve of the publication of the <international_energy> Agency's main publication , WorldEnergyOutlook , the agency's <chief_economist> , Fatih Birol , said in an interview , "If we want to act before the climate and supply security issues become irreversible , we need to make decisions now .
"The question is whether the G8 is still a timely organization ," Merkel said , launching a conventional dialogue mechanism with the five countries , not just a few hours of talks at the G8 summit , but "an answer to the question ."
My economists Andrew Oswald and Rainer Winkelmann have conducted a new study on the "delayed appropriation" of lotteries among winners . The study found that earned income is considered intrinsically appropriate , but not the appropriation of lotteries . The winners do not immediately think that they are appropriate , because lotteries create an unnecessary cognitive bias – a process in which two contradictory ideas exist in one's mind . The winners think , "This money makes me happy , but I'm not sure I really have the right to use it ." However , as time passes , the winners can persuade themselves to think that they deserve it . Experience shows that the gradual disappearance of cognitive bias takes about two years .
In order to expand abroad , some <chinese_companies> have signed strange agreements . Hung Stark has signed a sponsorship agreement with the North Korean Olympic delegation , and <li_ning> has agreed to sponsor the Sudanese Olympic team . China's Sudanese policy has been harshly criticized by some .
Reinhard Siekaczek , a former Siemens executive , received a groundbreaking trial yesterday for corporate bribery and was sentenced to a large fine and two years in prison for his involvement in setting up a bribery fund to win contracts for the engineering group .
The U .S . Treasury and the <federal_reserve> do not want to see a British-style non-executive chairman flying from London every week for two or three days to monitor the performance of Mr . Powell . They want to be reassured that American taxpayers' money is in the hands of familiar Americans .
China's banks often need large amounts of capital to meet government-led large-scale lending demands , and their role as investors often requires concessions . It is no better to have an unreliable "partner" with 10% shares than to have a "partner" with 5% shares but more repayable than to have a "partner" with more repayable shares .
Europe , therefore , has the opportunity , under the leadership of Germany and France , to advocate a different model , one that follows European traditions and that supports <financial_innovation> while implementing stronger regulation rather than constraints .
With cost inflation and the slowdown of the external economy , the best performing industries will be those that benefit from <domestic_demand> and can access top-down resources , said Li , adding that the down-to-bottom <raw_materials> processing companies will be the first to feel the impact of the rise .
"If a project is not economically meaningful , it will not provide a sustainable solution ," said Michael Snyder , chairman of the Policy and Resources Committee of the City of London Authority . "The London Agreement will make London's talents financial innovators to serve emerging <climate_change> industries .
"In terms of oil , the main objective of <government_policy> is to ensure supplies for the Olympics this month . Strong import growth indicates that the supply system is operating above the minimum inventory requirement , but there are no signs that stocks have increased in proportion to observed <demand_growth> ; it is therefore unlikely that there will be a significant surplus of stocks , especially when around 100 ,000 cars restart after the Olympics .
Although the political signs are still pessimistic , however , we have reason to have hope for the economy . Spain and Ireland , the two countries most severely affected by the <debt_crisis> and austerity , are finally recovering . The Spanish economy is expected to grow by 2 per cent this year , while Ireland's <unemployment_rate> will soon fall to 10 per cent . Even the Greek economy has returned to growth (before the latest developments in the crisis).
<international_monetary_fund> (IMF) and World Bank officials admit that the infrastructure needed in Congo is huge , but they are trying to determine whether Chinese loans are in line with the commitments made by the Congolese government , which has pledged not to sign new loans , except under preferential terms , under the two financial institutions' heavy-debt (poor-country) reduction plan .
The figure that could make a significant difference seems to be around 30%. Under this figure , women are a minority , often subjected to the fixed patterns that other minorities are subjected to . Above this level , they can create more extensive role models , become important mentors , and regulate a culture of over-maleisation in many senior positions . In the long run , only those with more than 30% female members in <senior_management> teams can change the gender picture in <european_companies> .
The biggest change in recent years , however , has been their willingness to invest heavily in <listed_companies> . Until now , the focus has been on the <financial_sector> . Just before the sub-prime crisis erupted , CIC had just taken off , investing $30 billion in equity shortly before Blackstone was listed in the U .S ., and Temasek in Singapore invested in Barclays , a British bank . But these funds have also suddenly appeared on the stock lists of some companies , such as AMD , a computer chip manufacturer , and Sony , a Japanese <electronics_group> , and the effects of these <sovereign_wealth_funds> are likely to expand .
The most influential is Fareed Zakaria’s The Post-American World , said to be Barack Obama’s only book on “diplomatic affairs” to be read this year . While Zakaria has tried to point out that the rise of China , India , and “other countries” will not pose a threat to the US , the inevitable conclusion is that the Bush era is the height of American power .
Then came the case of the sheep-headed dog meat--each company's advertisements seemed to be designed to convince students that there was no limit to opportunity , and that the culture of the company was to find the right people and give them the chance to grow . But things often change when you fill out the application and start the interview .
"If they come out again , it will have a profound impact on the prospects for state-owned companies to design , manufacture and sell cars in China ," Dunn said .
However , the <investment_management> industry has not yet faced technological challenges . The industry has not been forced to lay off or reduce the costs of investors because new entrants have taken over the market . What has had an impact is that the arrival of online services has increased , rather than reduced , the costs of investors , and has enabled a number of new intermediaries to profit from people's savings by collecting <asset_management> fees . However , as portfolio management has begun to use computer algorithms , at least those fees have begun to fall . Forbes Magazine recently described a number of <us_companies> as "robot advisors" platforms that use exchanges (ETFs) to build portfolios and rebalancing those assets when they deviate from their targets and place them too far .
In China's burgeoning <capital_markets> , <investor_sentiment> has plummeted . In 1992 , thousands of investors condemned <government_officials> for manipulating IPOs , one of the worst riots in China since <tiananmen_square> .
Yes , the rate of decline in exports is slowing , but deliveries in September are still 15% lower than in the month of Lehman's bankruptcy , the 11th <consecutive_month> of decline , and not much better than in the darkest days of March (17%). The longer the downturn in exports lasts , the longer the time fixed-asset investment needs to fill the gap , the risk of a decline in investment affecting <economic_growth> .
Crayhill Capital Management , a New York-based subsidiary of another credit fund , recently announced a $300 million investment in a trading financing platform operated by Britain's trading finance provider Stenn International , which purchases trade receipts from China's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and Southeast Asia's export suppliers , who export <consumer_products> such as clothing , toys and electronics to large Western retailers .
The <explosive_growth> in personal wealth means that <global_banks> with "private banking" operations , specialized in corporate finance , and "investment banking" are really at the forefront .
We seem to have experienced this before . Obama's speech after the BP leak was astonishingly similar as that of President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s , when he tried to use the recent oil crisis to change U .S . <energy_policy> without success . Obama acknowledged the similarities between the two speeches , but promised that the outcome would be different .

Asia's <stock_markets> have weakened this week due to Friday's downturn in the U .S . markets , but the reversal has been strengthened by the overwhelming victory of the wild KMT in last weekend's Taiwan Legislative Assembly elections , with <hong_kong> and Singapore falling 1 .5% and 2 .1% respectively .
These data confirm recent studies by UBS and the World Bank that <chinese_exports> are broader than 10 years ago and prices have also risen in the past two years .
"The number of transactions raising more than $1 billion has declined dramatically ," said Matthew Koder , UBS's <global_capital_markets> co-ordinator .
“The <trump_administration> is looking for other leverages and pressure points to persuade China to open up its markets and create an environment of fair competition ,” said Cai Reid .
PictetAssetManagement , a Swiss <asset_management> firm , believes it has benefited greatly from the move , as China’s debt-to-GDP ratio has essentially stopped rising after a decade of rising (sometimes terrifyingly fast) growth , and it expects it to decline as early as 2019 .
Presidents' wives are usually public figures , some of them fashionable White House hostesses and some powerful policy advocates , including Martha Washington , Dolly Madison , and Jacqueline Kennedy , while the latter include Eleanor Rosevelt and <hillary_clinton> .
<donald_trump> , the president-elect of the <united_states> – and his possible reelection – has been attributed to everything from American institutional racism to growing inequality .
Shanghai's banking assets totalled $419 billion , well below the $1 .029 billion of <hong_kong> . <hong_kong> boasts of having several world-class banks , while Shanghai's banks are in full development .
The only major contribution to the security of international gas supplies would be for the EU to create a competitive integrated gas market , which would also weaken Russia’s ability to influence bilateral gas relations and make it more possible for Europe to speak with Moscow with one voice .
“The <profit_margins> will continue to shrink ,” says Gabriel Chan , an analyst at Credit Suisse , noting that the main reason is that new casinos will fill the market in the next two years , with five new casinos opening next year , increasing the number of tables by one-third , and five new casinos entering the market by 2010 , increasing the number of tables by one-quarter , to 7526 .
All countries have the right to protect “national security” interests , especially 5G telecommunications – the neural system of the future digital economy and the “Internet of Things” (Internet of Things). However , the actions taken by the <trump_administration> last week go far beyond responding to <security_concerns> , and appear to be far more than an attempt to force Beijing to reach a <trade_agreement> .
The <united_arab> Emirates' Advanced Technology <investment_corporation> (ATIC) yesterday announced a $1 .8 billion acquisition of Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing , a losing Singapore chip replacement company , to form a powerful rival to Taiwan's dominant semiconductor industry .
"Our defence and military networks are constantly being attacked . Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations have expressed their intention to launch network attacks against the <united_states> that are more difficult to detect and prevent ," Obama said .
The <european_central_bank> (ECB) has always done better than it did in supporting <european_governments> in providing aid to the <european_banking> sector .Whereas <sovereign_debt> in Spain and Ireland is largely generated by its bankers and is only generous to the <banking_sector> , what is the logic ?Whereas today’s problems in Europe include two sides that are mutually reinforcing : the weak <banking_sector> and the weak government , why should we turn our attention to one side ?
India protested that a small patrol unit of Chinese troops crossed the disputed border between the two countries in the Himalayan region last week and is currently camped several kilometres in territory normally controlled by India .
Alex Salmond delivered a speech at the <annual_meeting> of the Scottish National Party (SNP), which is unfortunately not attended by anyone outside Scotland , as the Conservatives , led by <david_cameron> , once again engage in a debate about leaving the EU , are pushing Scotland out of Britain .
The answer depends on the unique characteristics of the recession , which has been triggered by two factors : the collapse of the U .S . <housing_bubble> and the collapse of the credit bubble . I do not believe that the Fed's massive <interest_rate_cuts> will resolve the extreme imbalance in supply and demand in the U .S . <housing_market> , a imbalance that will continue to drive down <housing_prices> over time . I do not believe that the Fed's actions will restore the <credit_market> to pre-crisis levels . Thus , the <real_estate_market> , and even consumers who rely on credit , may still face enormous pressure , with the <real_estate_market> accounting for a record 72% of U .S . GDP .
The fluctuations in the <exchange_rate> have not brought them much benefit ; Distell , the only major local wine producer , relies mainly on liquor and <domestic_markets> .The multinational brewery has lately failed to invest in <south_africa> , despite the fact that US wine giant Gallo has been looking for a long time and plans to collaborate with another major <south_african> producer , Swatland , to launch a series of products .
The fact that <hu_jintao> , the <general_secretary> of the CPC and the president of the state , has only included Li Keqiang's key supporter in the core of his leadership shows the limitations of his power in an increasingly consensus-based system .However , <hu_jintao> has increased the number of his supporters in the newly elected political bureau and , overall , strengthened his own strength .
Yesterday's <global_credit> market was one of the worst trading days in decades because of fears that some investors would be forced to sell assets to compensate for the collapse of subprime markets .
Tundra and Sequoia will resume production next month , and Toyota said , "Production will be slow and we will have to see how the market goes ."
Great champions know how to pull back at the peak .DeepMind , Alphabet's AI lab , has decided that its computer program AlphaGo will no longer focus on winning the next round of chess .Instead , the focus will be on "developing advanced generic algorithms that will one day help scientists solve some of the most complex problems we face , such as finding new treatments for diseases ," says Demis Hassabis , <chief_executive> of DeepMind .
In a letter to other G20 countries , the leaders expressed disappointment at the slow pace of progress this year and warned that "if there is no cooperative action to make the necessary adjustments to achieve (strong and sustainable growth), the risks of future crises and low growth will continue to exist ."
Not only are <stock_market> investors concerned about the health of banks , but the banks themselves are concerned . Currently , the difference between the <us_dollar> , euro and pound <lending_rates> for the March and June periods and the expected official <interest_rates> has widened compared to March , with the June loan margins being on par with the previous two peak levels in September and December .(See Chart)
